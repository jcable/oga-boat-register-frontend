Phibbs bought her in 1931. A 7hp Kelvin engine was fitted, in the fo&#39;csl, whilst fishing, but removed by Mike Johnson. Elizabeth Mary&#39;s rig was that of Polperro gaffer with a loose-footed boomless mainsail which was altered for dredging after the second world war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her Plymouth fishing registration, PH107 came about because a previous owner, Col. Phibbs had registered her as a British vessel in that port and when a subsequent owner tried to re-register her as a fishing vessel, the port could only be changed at expense. Her original fishing number is believed to be FY28. The following article was written by her owner in 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&rsquo;Elizabeth Mary&rsquo; was built at Looe by Pearce in 1908, allegedly as a Plymouth Hooker, but I haven&#39;t seen any other Hooker that looked at all like her and I suspect she was really built as a Polperro Gaffer, examples of which can be seen in Edgar March&rsquo;s &#39;Inshore Craft&#39; book. She would have been used us a long liner, fishing between the Start and the Lizard mostly. Nothing is really known of her until she was bought by a Marines Capt. William O&rsquo;Hara Phibbs in 1931. He converted her to a yacht complete with cabin and eventually a small engine.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She next changed hands in 1962 when she was bought by Mrs. Doreen Johnson of Penryn near Falmouth. She was transferred to her son Michael in 1970. He did a terrific amount of work on her which included taking the cabin off again and opening her up ready for use dredging oysters in the Fal estuary. She was re-decked, had new mast partners, beam shelves, frames where necessary, re-planked in part, new spars and rigging and a new rudder. With the help of a White Fish grant he also put in a Saab diesel engine. Mike Johnson worked her under sail for 2 or 3 seasons, and he took part in the local Gaffers races, unfortunately without too much success, apart that is from the Fowey passage races which he won on more than one occasion.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Although dredging is only allowed under sail between 9am and 3pm, it is permitted to motor to the grounds before or after dredging. The thin end of the wedge for working sailing craft in Britain perhaps. Eventually however, Mike removed this engine which was how I bought her in partnership with Mike Birch, who has recently won the Jester Class trophy and first multihull trophy in the 1976 Single Handed Transatlantic Race. One day he will turn up at one of our Gaffers races with a gaff rigged Trimaran!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She has only been used for pleasure, with the odd charter thrown in, since we&#39;ve had her here in Dartmouth, and of course we&#39;ve taken part in the local races when possible. Our first success was in a passage race during a regatta when with Mike&rsquo;s wife Jo helming, we sailed from Torquay to Dartmouth and finished second in front of 16 modern Bermudian craft. On corrected time we won by 15 minutes and so our rating was amended accordingly to leave us with a two minute victory. In 1976 we repeated the performance and won by eleven minutes after having led all the way to the last mark, some 200 yards from home, at which point a Bowman 46 managed to pass us - just.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Mike Birch&#39;s delivery work and involvement in Round Britain and single handed racing didn&#39;t give him much time to use &lsquo;Elizabeth Mary&rsquo; and so he sold me his shore early in 1976. We have taken part in the three South Western Old Gaffers Races with fair success, winning Class 2 in 1976, and taking the SW Commodore&#39;s Pennant as first SW boat. We made a hair raising passage up to Cowes in 1975, to finish second in the class, and to collect the Edgar J. March Memorial Trophy for the first work boat to finish. During the gale following that race, &lsquo;Elizabeth Mary&rsquo; was damaged and her gaff broken.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>By the time repairs were effected and the weather looked anything like decent, it was November and we were not altogether happy about the prospect of a Channel passage under sail in an open boat in what was really winter. It turned out to be better than we had feared, and apart from a bumpy ride off Anvil, we made the passage to Dartmouth in about 16 hours, including a few zig-zags through the Russian fishing fleet resident in Lyme Bay at that time of year.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>Written by Trevor Vincett, OGA member in the South West who sold &lsquo;Elizabeth Mary&rsquo; to JDA Burn of Totness in 1977.<br />\r\nFirst published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter, 1977/3.</h4>","image_key":"nGfCds","uk_part1":"162911","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Larch  carvel ","draft":1.3198,"generic_type":"Polperro Gaffer","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":20,"head":20,"luff":19},"topsail":{"luff":20,"perpendicular":7},"length_overall":8.0772,"calculated_thcf":1.007,"fore_triangle_base":7.3152,"length_on_waterline":7.9248,"fore_triangle_height":8.8392},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.0772,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Elizabeth Mary&#39; was built at Looe, Cornwall by Pearce in 1908, allegadly as a Plymouth hooker.

A gaff cutter of a little over thirty feet, perhaps &lsquo;graced&rsquo; may be the wrong word, but her unmistakable lines gave her a special charm that was all her own. Built in Poole Harbour around 1898, she was originally an open fishing boat but was commissioned as a yacht in 1908 when she acquired the name Playmate. In 1924 she was decked and a cabin added and later still, in 1965, she had a doghouse fitted. Her skipper, John Maxwell, has owned her for twenty-four years, nearly a quarter of her life, initially sailing out of Gravesend. Then in 1989 Playmate arrived in Bristol from where she twice sailed to Brittany. In 2001 John moved her to Portishead when the new marina opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playmate was built every inch as a working boat and she retained that character for the rest of her days; there was never anything bright and shiny about her decks or down below! But then perhaps the same could be said of her skipper&rsquo;s philosophy - if something still works, even if it does need a little coaxing, why does it need replacing? In many ways the boat and her skipper were made for each other - both have long, traditional sailing backgrounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2010 turned out to be a seminal year for Playmate. In May there came a splendid early season cruise in company, the story of which will be related in the June edition of Gaffers Log. The next month Playmate made passage to Cardiff Bay for an OGA gathering. On the way, with an inexperienced helmsman, she came rather too close to a starboard mark and gave the stern a bit of a clout but temporary repairs saw her safely home. Then in late summer came the Holms Race, starting at Portishead, sailing down channel to pass between Flat Holm and Steep Holm and back with the tide. On the outward leg, the lee decks were under and she started taking in water faster than it could be pumped out. The water in the cabin became so deep that it got into the electrics and the crew were unable to start the engine. A call for assistance went out and Playmate was towed back into Portishead by the lifeboat where she was immediately craned onto the hard. It was her last outing. Removal of soft planks revealed rotten frames and ribs. Some of the remaining planks started to drop because the screws simply pulled out of the frames. The deck beams were no longer securely attached to the hull - obviously a major factor in why she was leaking and explained why she was permanently damp down below. The surveyor declared her unseaworthy and advised a minimum of &pound;20,000 of repair work to make her safe - more than twice her value even as a seaworthy vessel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few wooden boats of her size last over a hundred years without a lot of money being spent. For many years repairs had been carried out by her skipper at little cost - sadly her time had come, despite all the joy she had brought, there was little option but for her to be broken up. A sad end indeed for what may have been the oldest boat still sailing the Bristol Channel.</p>","image_key":"5NPHhM","uk_part1":"128581","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel pitch pine on oak originally transom stern, counter added 1962 increasing length from 26ft","draft":1.2192,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":17.3,"head":12.4,"luff":16.3},"length_overall":9.2354,"calculated_thcf":0.957,"fore_triangle_base":4.8768,"length_on_waterline":8.6868,"fore_triangle_height":8.6868},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.2354,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"Built in 1898, Playmate was a 30' gaff cutter.

The deck was most likely originally open, with a large cockpit. Future kings of Great Britain, Edward VIII and George VI as well as Prince George, Duke of Kent were all cadets at Osborne during this period and probably trained on Star. In 1921, the College was moved to Dartmouth. Star remained on the RN register until 1925 but was sold locally on the IoW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925 she entered Lloyd&#39;s Register of Yachts as owned by&nbsp;Mr. Martin H. Ellis. She is believed to have had a small refit back at Wade&rsquo;s. She was to stay on the island until 1939 when she was sold to Mr. F. Stanley Lewis of Fambridge. The Essex rivers clearly agreed with her and at various times she was kept at Tollesbury, Maldon and West Mersea. She had a major refit in 1955 at William King&rsquo;s yard in Burnham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Margaret &lsquo;Pat&rsquo; Miller of Tollesbury bought her in 1957 and raced her in the first East Coast Old Gaffers race in 1963. She is described in the race notes as a 26&#39; cutter, with white and red sails, and white topsides, flying a green flag with a white star. Of the 30 boats that started the race only 7 completed the course, and Star was one of the ones that retired. Far from being put off by the experience, the same owner raced her every year up to 1969, winning the Cup for Trying in 1968. The Cup for Trying was awarded annually to the boat with the best aggregate performance in the current and previous races and not winning a prize in any of the races.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L.A Vincent of Tolleshunt D&#39;Arcy bought her in 1970-1. He gave her a thorough refit and she continued racing under his ownership until at least 1974. A 1981 survey for the then owner John Thorne describes her as a &#39;well constructed yacht and in a basically sound condition for her age&#39;. Sometime after that she was bought afloat, but leaking, and left ashore, with hope of repairs that never happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1986, she was found by Christopher Fittock who wanted a boat ready to sail, but fell in love with Star, who needed a little more attention. Handy, but inexperienced in boat building, it took him six years to get her afloat. He rebuilt the stern and stem post, replaced the deck, 30% of the planks and 70% of the elm keel. The Stuart Turner engine was replaced with a new Dolphine two stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Re-launched at the Downs Road Boatyard she was meant to be rigged but the owner went to sea on a tall ship, married and moved to Lancashire. Eventually he brought her up to Morecambe Bay but increasing family commitments rendered her sale essential. The last maintenance work in England was made at the David Moss shipyard in Skippool in 2005. Back in the East Coast hands of Colin Francis of Maldon, by October 2006 she was back down at West Mersea and reviewed in Classic Boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Michele Ivaldi bought her in 2007 and brought her to the Costantini brother&rsquo;s yard on Lake Maggiore, Italy, for a long and difficult restoration. She was re-launched on the shores of Lake Maggiore on June 16, 2012 and nominated for the Classic Boat Restoration of the Year (under 40ft, Europe) awards in 2013.

I met Reg Shelley who researched the River Police and he had found the minutes at ERO and recorded all that was said about the River Police, transcribed word for word. My detailed handwritten notes from meeting Reg&nbsp; on 6th July 2011 include direct quotes from his notes.<br /><strong>Jan 1897</strong> Inspector Thomas Poole requests a new boat, funding discussed.<br /><strong>Feb 1897</strong> Put out to tender. Aldous gets job at &pound;65.<br /><strong>April 1897</strong> New boat tested and named 'Victoria'. 1897 was the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.</p><h3>Designed by? Mr Polly?</h3><p>Peter Fisher who wrote &ldquo;The Waterguard&rdquo; wrote (to then owner Ben Powell) to say that he had located records of Aldous&rsquo; yard but that no record was included of Police boats. He says, &ldquo;It was said that all of them were built there and designed by a Mr Polly, a draughtsman working there at that time.&rdquo;</p><p>At Brightlingsea Museum we went through Parish Magazines which had &ldquo;Boatyard News&rdquo; including Aldous but no mention in 1896 to 1900 of any boats for the police. (Too small?) I have been told that the Aldous records are at the Nottage Institute in Wivenhoe but not sure if this is true. I have not seen them.</p><p><strong>Early years</strong> from Watch Committee Minutes (via Reg Shelley, more info in my handwritten notes).<br /><strong>1902</strong> recommended to improve her by altering deckplan and providing a cabin top approx &pound;10<br /><strong>1908</strong> &ldquo;Needful work&rdquo; approved, Aldous &pound;19 17s 6d. Given the cost this must surely be the &ldquo;carvelling over&rdquo; of the hull which was a major job undertaken at around that time.</p><p>These dates show that for 5 years Victoria was a clinker half-decker with no cabin, for a further 6 years she was clinker with a cabin and then for 109 years (2017) she has been carvel with cabin.<br />At no time has she ever been a carvel half-decker.</p><h3>Earliest photo &ndash; Victoria second from left?</h3><p>The early photo (early 1900s) showing 4 police sailing boats appears in several books. Victoria is named as one of them.<br />Peter Fisher in WaterGuard captions the picture as &ldquo;Prince of Wales leads the race for home waters in the River Colne followed by Victoria, Colne and Alexandra in hot pursuit&rdquo;.<br />Harvey Benham in &ldquo;Last Stronghold of Sail&rdquo; also has Prince of Wales on the left. Prince of Wales was built in 1903 so Victoria would have her cabin by then. If the photo was taken before 1908 she was still clinker.<br />The second from left looks to be clinker (and possibly with Victoria&rsquo;s distinctive cabin) which would put the photo at before 1908. If an original print of the picture could be obtained it could be blown up to shed further light. A report on the Police Regatta in 1896 mentions Colne at about 8.5 tons. Victoria (2017) is about 3 tons. She can&rsquo;t be the one on the far right as that is a carvel boat with no cabin and Victoria was still clinker when she acquired her cabin.</p><p>I have not managed to trace the date or source of the photo &ndash; it might have been for a newspaper. We met Tom Moulton in Brightlingsea whose grandfather was in the River Police and he had a good, perhaps original, copy of this image framed on his wall. Tom has since died and I wrote to the family to ask if they still have it and whether we might scan and enlarge it &ndash; response awaited as at May 2017.</p><h3>Photo of Poole in the cockpit of Victoria</h3><p>I was allowed to make a copy of this picture by his great granddaughter Sue Haywood and there are extensive notes about his life and family which also came from her. I followed him with interest as he was clearly a charismatic figure, meriting a whole chapter to himself in Hervey Benham&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Last stronghold of sail&rdquo;. Is it Victoria he&rsquo;s standing in? The curved cabin top is right, the doors appear in later photos, though gone now (there&rsquo;s a sliding hatch, added in the 1950s or 60s, perhaps when an engine was put in). The mainsheet horse and tiller match later photos. The cockpit looks just right and the size is right. In the police she was &ldquo;his boat&rdquo;. I say it&rsquo;s her!</p><h3>Sold to Tom Poole &ndash; 1920? (He still owned her in 1931 but not sure when he sold her)</h3><p>Poole retired in 1920. An undated note from Tom Poole, of which we have a copy, says &ldquo;I was Inspector of River Police and used Victoria especially for my own use. When she was sold out of the service I bought her&rdquo;. Reg Shelley going through the Watch Committee Minutes found nothing about the sale of the boat. He thinks that perhaps Poole acquired her when he retired in 1920 after 30 years service, but there is no official record of this.</p><h3>Photo of Victoria racing 1929 &ndash; and old gossip</h3><p>We found 2 old postcards with this photo at Brightlingsea Museum with different captions. Also got some photos and clippings and notes in Poole&rsquo;s own hand, from his great granddaughter (SH) which refer to Miss Fieldgate sailing Victoria in the Ladies race. I met Sheila Mortlock, (Sue&rsquo;s Mum and married to Poole&rsquo;s grandson) in 2011 or 2012 when she was already well into her 90s. She remembered Gracie Fieldgate and said they always thought there was something going on between her and Poole. She used to collect his rents. I have been unable to find out what happened to Gracie &ndash; might not have been her real first name. No evidence to suggest that she acquired Victoria from Poole (or any other boat).</p><h3>1931-193? The missing years</h3><p>Colne Yacht Club Members' Handbooks have Poole listed there 1921 to 1937 and Victoria listed under his name from 1929 to 1931. I asked Lyn Mathams (Brightlingsea), who has copies of these handbooks, whether Victoria appeared in the years following and she reported not. I would like to look at the records for the Brightlingsea Sailing Club as we know from newspaper cuttings that Poole was sailing her in their races too at this time. As at 15th May 2017 am awaiting a response from the President of Brightlingsea Sailing Club.</p><h3>Who did Poole sell Victoria to and when?</h3><p>This is a gap in our knowledge. Sid Hunt owned Victoria from the early 30s but we think there may have been an owner in between. Someone mentioned the possibility that Victoria was given to someone as a 21st birthday present &ndash; can&rsquo;t remember if it was Ben or Marian who suggested this possibility. Ben says it doesn&rsquo;t ring any bells so it must have been Marion or her brother. Not a very long-lived present if that was the case. It would also be interesting to see when she first appears in any records at Orwell Yacht Club under Sid&rsquo;s name &ndash; so far the first proof we have in newspaper cuttings of race results from 1936.</p><h3>Sid Hunt&rsquo;s long ownership &ndash; 193? - 1981</h3><p>So the date he acquired her is not known. Somewhere between 1931 when Poole still had her at Brightlingsea and 1935 when Poole writes about Victoria in reply to another owner. He owned her jointly with his friend Ralph Blowers at first and Marian told me they owned it jointly &ldquo;for a while&rdquo;. We have a copy of the bill of sale when Sid bought Ralph&rsquo;s share dated 1937.</p><h3>Letter from Poole 1935</h3><p>We only have a copy of this letter not the original. It is a reply to an enquiry about the boat&rsquo;s history. I met Marian Rosling, Sid&rsquo;s daughter and neither she nor her brother John Hunt, who I also met, remembered seeing the letter and she said it was not among his papers. Perhaps Ben had a photocopy and his co-owner Roddy Munroe had the original? I have transcribed it &ndash; some bits are quite difficult to make out and there may be errors. Significantly I feel that from the tone of the letter he is not addressing the person he sold Victoria to but rather to a later owner. Hence the search for a missing owner. But this may not be the case. Perhaps the boat was sold directly to Sid Hunt through a third party, and then Sid wrote to Poole.</p><h3>Accuracy of Poole&rsquo;s letter</h3><h3>He is inaccurate about the exact dates as the above research shows.<br /><br />Pictures of Victoria during Sid Hunt&rsquo;s ownership</h3><p>Marian Rosling is the daughter of Sid Hunt &ndash; she and her brother John sailed on Victoria as children with their parents&nbsp; and remember her well. Marian kindly lent me the photos to scan &ndash; individual scans are on the USB stick. Sid raced Victoria with Orwell Yacht Club before the war &ndash; a newspaper cutting with results of their sea races dated 1936 has him winning the most points in the sea races that season.</p><p>They told us that the keel-stepped mast was snapped off at the deck during a race to Roughs Towers and was put back in a steel sleeve, so approx 3ft shorter. Mast we think is original &ndash; it is hollow and was made from a spinnaker pole from a J Class. We believe she was laid up during the war. Marian and her brother told us that after the war (in 1948) the plate and lead keel was removed and Sid sold the lead for a good price. He did not replace the plate but had a small saloon which young family fitted in for holidays &ndash; see photos.</p><h3>1981 time for new owner</h3><p>Sid refused offers for Victoria from other members of the Orwell Yacht Club even though he was no longer sailing her. She was getting neglected. In 1981 (Sid was aged 69) he replied to advert in paper placed by Ben Powell and Roddy Monroe.<br />&ldquo;Old traditional yacht required, 20ft plus, and condition, seen&rdquo;.<br />Ben and Roddy met him and he must have liked them as he sold her for &pound;625.</p><h3>Ben Powell&rsquo;s ownership 1981 to 2009</h3><p>Ben and Roddy sailed her for a while and then undertook an extensive rebuild 1989/90/91. Detailed documentation of this work, carried out with the help of Mick Newman (who went on to co-found Spirit Yachts) is in the paper record. Roddy become much less involved over time and Ben had Victoria pretty much to himself until he decided in 2008 that he might sell her.<br /><br /><strong>Engine</strong> Sid Hunt had fitted a Stuart Turner 4 which was not very reliable and was taken out for the restoration (late 80s) and initially not replaced. Ben and Roddy installed a 7hp Vire a year or two after the restoration. The propeller is offset on the starboard quarter.</p><h3>Howard Wheelton and Sue Lewis: owners 2009 &ndash; 2017</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.victoria1897.blogspot.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Visit the blog</a> for a more detailed account of our adventures, including 2 trips to France on her own lorry and 2 trips to the Netherlands by sea.<br />&nbsp;<br />Key dates</p><p>2010/2011: Between seasons Howard converted Victoria&rsquo;s keel-stepped mast to deck-stepped, adapting a tabernacle from a Dauntless.

Luke Akhurst, 17 joined Tom for a never to be forgotten day. As part of the winning crew he went home with his own trophy to remember the experience.<p>In addition to this, Hamble Sea Scouts managed to get &lsquo;Stonechat&rsquo;, their elderly 30 foot, 11 ton gaff ketch around the course. Never a light winds flyer she picked up her skirts in the blustery conditions and reached just under 8 knots at times. Despite a broken main boom held together by sail ties she gave great sport. Helmed from start to finish by Chris Ackhurst, 14, crewed by Alex Cunningham, 13 and skippered by leader Terry Hawkes they were awarded the prize for most improved performance. Again both boys went home clutching half pint commemorative pots.<p>Now if that&rsquo;s not the way to get the younger generation to join in the fun and appreciate the past, I can&rsquo;t think what will. Hamble Sea Scouts would like to thank Tom Cunliffe and the OGA for their support and encouragement.</blockquote><p>In 2014, the OGA provided funds to support purchase of&nbsp;a VHF radio for &lsquo;Stonechat&rsquo;. <a href=\"https://www.oga.org.uk/_documents/%5B518574%5DStonechat.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read a report here.</a><p>The sailing yacht &lsquo;Stonechat&rsquo; was privately built in Essex by the late Austin Edge.

The East Coast is a wonderful cruising area and I wonder now why it took so long before I made the effort to visit. The people are kindness itself, the scenery is beautiful, the waterways exciting to navigate, and the pubs fun. Every waterway has somewhere to anchor, and always seems to have two rivers conveniently attached and at different angles so there is always a sheltered anchorage.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I would like to thank the person who so kindly ran down the banks of the Crouch trying to get my attention to say that a free berth had been arranged up river; sadly I was looking the other way. It would have saved me from the interesting experience of a full ebb and a strong contrary sea breeze leading down to the Spitway!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I was amazed by how many Thames Barges are still plying these waters. I think I counted 16. Seeing them sailing is the most wonderful sight. I witnessed some marvellous seamanship and my congratulations to all those skippers. We had a great lunchtime &lsquo;lock- in&rsquo; at the Manningtree Yacht Club (Constable country); thank you Steve and John. I have to admit to anchoring &#39;Lucy&#39; at Orford and catching a lift with those wiley &lsquo;grand parents&rsquo; Tim and Liz Dodwell up to Snape. They were to continue on through the Netherlands and up the Baltic to winter the boat in Marienhamm in Finland; a great adventure and good example of adventure to us all.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We were blessed with offshore winds for most of the time which allowed easy access to the Rivers Ore and Deben. Southwold Regatta was a memorable weekend with great weather and entertainment. The local brewery was extremely generous in its prizes and I am not quite sure what race it was that Lucy won, but 35 pints of Adnams best bitter was dutifully carried onboard and shipped across the North Sea for dispensing at the Hellevoetsluis Regatta (probably wangled by Jon so that he would not run dry of his best tipple!!).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Thank you again East Coast; it was a great example of how to host a visiting Gaffer.

They bought the boat in 1911 and cruised her around the Solent and down the West Country. In 1912 they sailed up to the Baltic to Copenhagen. The trip is recorded in the CA Bulletin and an original log.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 1913 they returned and sailed her up to Russia at Kronstadt before returning to Cowes on September 23rd. They met Erskine Childers in Kalmar on July 29th. Both Carson and Childers record the meeting in their logs. Carson won the CA&#39;s Love Cup in 1912 and 1913 for their cruise and the RCC&#39;s Romola Cup in 1913. In October 1919 they sailed from Cowes to Le Havre, taking the boat down the French Canals to the Mediterranean arriving in January 1920. Carson then sailed the boat to Sete and took her through the Canal du Midi to Bordeaux. From there in August 1920 he and Beryl sailed the boat back to England. This trip is described in 6 Yachting Monthly articles published in 1921 and 1922. They sold the boat in January 1922.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Carson she had three owners in quick succession but in 1932 she was bought by Joseph Mew, a brewer on the Isle of Wight. He sailed her in the early Round the Island Races. A Beken photograph survives from this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1939 she was sold and taken to the East Coast. In 1950 she was converted to Bermudan at Dan Web and Feesey, then bought by Edgar Traylen in 1960. Whilst on the slip being fitted out she was recognised by Carson&#39;s daughter and this is how her history came to light. Traylen kept her on the Walton Backwaters for 20 years before selling her to Richard Barnard who converted her back to a gaff cutter using the Bermudan mast. However the rig was not powerful and the boat needed a good breeze to get her going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pat and Dick Dawson bought her in 1983 and sailed her back to the South Coast. She leaked a lot on this trip, resulting in a three year refit In 1989 the Dawsons replaced the rig based on the dimensions of her original rig recorded in her 1911 log. In their ownership she has cruised the south coast of England from Ramsgate to the Helford river in Cornwall, across the Channel to Normandy, the Channel Islands and the North Brittany coast.</p>","image_key":"nNtLcZ","uk_part1":"128988","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel pine on oak, elm keel, external lead keel, no internal ballast, teak brightwork.","draft":1.6764,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":16.58,"head":13.83,"luff":17.58},"topsail":{"luff":19,"perpendicular":6.83},"sailarea":5,"length_overall":8.0528,"calculated_thcf":0.953,"length_over_spars":10.3632,"fore_triangle_base":4.7762,"length_on_waterline":7.62,"fore_triangle_height":9.7536},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.0528,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>One off design probably based on the Poole fishing boats/pilot boats of the time.

A few years later Jimmy sold her to the Coghill family who gave it as a wedding present to their son Frank &amp; Jenny (nee Lee). I sailed on her occasionally with Frank &amp; Jenny. She was based at Cardwell Bay Sailing Club in Gourock at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming back to my father&rsquo;s connection, when he first sailed with his friend Andrew Motherwell, he was surprised and delighted to find he already knew the boat. Dad had in fact sailed on her as a young man in the late 1940s when she was owned by his friend Sandy Denny, whose family owned Denny&rsquo;s shipyard in Dumbarton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, &#39;Thistle&#39; was restored by a French boatyard and raced - by Bruno Peyron, no less - on the Mediterranean classic yacht regatta circuit. She was re-named &#39;Lady Trix&#39;, after her original 1909 name of &#39;Trix&#39;. &nbsp;In fact her rudder post, when I sailed on her in the 1970s, still had the name &#39;Trix&#39; engraved into the brass top fitting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems she was hit by a 6 metre and holed badly in a regatta at Antibes. There were magazine reports and photographs of the collision, and I have not heard of her since. The magazine articles of the collision, as well as an article describing the lengthy restoration project, may be found on the internet by googling &ldquo;Lady Trix yacht&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believed she was built for Lady Coats (wife of a scion of the Paisley thread-making dynasty), but there is another story that she was built for the wife of a Glasgow steel magnate who was well known to Alfred Mylne, the designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope this provides a little more colour about this wonderful boat. She handled beautifully and was a joy to sail. She was the first yacht I sailed on and I have very happy memories of sailing and racing her in my early teens with Andrew and my Dad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With warm memories, David Johnston</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.museemaritimelarochelle.fr/contenu/,les_yachts_agrees_sur_nos_quais,101?idbateau=57\" target=\"_blank\">Find an article in French, here, written in 2009</a></p>","image_key":"RPwzFh","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Pitch pine on steamed rock elm.","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":13.5,"head":13.25,"luff":17.67},"topsail":{"luff":14,"perpendicular":5.5},"sailarea":4,"length_overall":8.6868,"calculated_thcf":0.957,"fore_triangle_base":3.9624,"length_on_waterline":5.6388,"fore_triangle_height":7.0104},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":8.6868,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Thistle&#39;, previously known as &#39;Trix&#39; until 1946, was built in Scotland, 1909 to an Alfred Mylne design.

Her hull was constructed from 1&frac14;in. American redwood on 3in. sawn oak frames at 2&rsquo;6&rdquo; centres and 1&frac12;&rdquo;x 1&rdquo; steamed oak ribs at 10&rdquo; centres. Her keelson and deadwood were elm. The foredeck was 1&frac14;&rdquo; teak and the stern deck 1&frac14;&rdquo; pine. The long keel is &frac12; ton cast iron and there are an additional 1&frac14; tons of cast iron and lead internal ballast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Displacement, in cruising trim, is estimated at a little over 4 tons. The pine mast is deck stepped in a tabernacle which extends to the keel. The mast can be easily raised and lowered by one person using the sheer pole and tackle. Standing rigging is galvanised steel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Refurbishment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bought by Kit Platten in 1998, she has subsequently been restored to a high standard and at considerable expense, with over &pound;25,000 spent on professional assistance between 2011 - 2015. The cabin and cockpit have been completely rebuilt, the stern deck sheathed with 6mm ply and 8mm teak caulked with Sikaflex and the existing teak foredeck refastened with A4 stainless steel screws and re-caulked. The engine was repositioned and she was given a new stainless steel stern tube and prop shaft, bronze propeller and stern glands. She was sailing again in 2004 and has been extensively cruised along the East Coast during the summer whilst the internal refurbishment continued during the winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011 she underwent a major structural overhaul which included burning off the hull, raking out all seams, stripping out any rotten planking and drenching all exposed timber with wood preservative. Frames were doubled with Iroko and ribs with steamed oak. She was re-planked with 1&frac14;&rdquo; larch and completely refastened with bronze screws or copper nails and roves. Seams were re-caulked with cotton and red lead putty. The rudder was rebuilt, the keel bolts replaced and a new galvanised steel stem band fitted. She also has a new bowsprit and boom gallows.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Jabsco Standard toilet with bronze skin fittings is installed in the forepeak. There is ample racking for sail bags and easy access to the chain locker with 30m of galvanised chain spliced to 30m of 14mm anchorplait warp. The 20lb CQR bower anchor is stowed on the foredeck. There is also a 15lb CQR kedge anchor with 30m of 12mm anchorplait. There is one bulkhead mounted 12v lamp and wiring is in place for a second lamp if required. A &ldquo;modesty curtain&rdquo; separates the forepeak from the saloon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comfortable saloon extends the full width of the boat, has 5&rsquo;6&rdquo; headroom with full standing headroom under the skylight and ample locker and shelf space. The saloon table is demountable and can be stored against the forward bulkhead. There are two bulkhead mounted 12v lamps and a 12v LED reading lamp at the head of the starboard berth. The 4&rdquo; thick berth cushions were new in 2013 and have a memory foam topping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spacious galley is fitted with a gimballed Techimpex two burner gas cooker with oven (new in 2012) and there is a deep stainless steel sink with bronze water pump and faucet fed from a 25litre container in the forepeak. Additional water containers are stored under the saloon berths. Waste water is discharged overboard by an electric pump. There is generous work top space and plenty of drawers, lockers and shelves. There is a full set of china and plastic crockery, polycarbonate glasses, stainless steel cutlery and galley utensils as well as pots, pans, a pressure cooker, chopping boards, storage containers etc. etc. A fluorescent lamp is mounted on the beam shelf above the cooker &nbsp;and there is a 13a 220v twin socket for use when shore power is available. There is even an electric kettle and toaster! The engine box acts as a useful seat when working in the galley. A fire blanket is mounted adjacent to the sink and a fire extinguisher on the port side of the companionway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The navigation area has a large chart table with ample stowage for spare charts and pilot books. The bulkhead between the table and the saloon is faced with cork pin board and there is a useful bookshelf above. All instruments are within easy reach. There is a fluorescent lamp fixed to the port beam shelf as well as a flexible chart table lamp. A 13a 230v twin socket and 12v socket are mounted on the outboard bulkhead. The navigator sits on the head of the quarter berth with ample knee room under the chart table. Two 110 amp/hour sealed batteries are situated under the navigator&rsquo;s seat. The switchboard is mounted on the face of a locker fitted to the cockpit bulkhead with wiring easily accessible from inside the locker that also contains the shore powered battery charger and a16a 230v CCU. The locker has a separate space for the first aid kit, medicine box, spare fuses and torches etc. All 12v wiring is marine grade and concealed within or behind bulkheads and easily accessible via removable panels. There is a 220v ring main with twin socket outlets in the navigation and galley areas with provision for a third socket in the forward Saloon bulkhead if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ducati engine is easily accessed via a removable cover that also acts as the companionway and as a useful seat for the galley. The engine is extremely reliable, has always started first time and, being air-cooled, is ideal for use in the shoal waters of the East Coast. It has proved very economical and burns practically no oil. The fuel tank holds 12 gallons (55 litres) and is housed under the stern deck accessible via a hatch. Above the engine and under the bridge deck is a large locker for life jackets, safety harnesses spare hats etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On Deck</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The cockpit has a large locker with lift up lid to starboard with ample room for fuel cans, engine accessories, fenders etc. There is a smaller locker with lift up lid to port for mooring warps and 3 open fronted bins for furling ties, spare lines, and drinks bottles. The stern coaming is drilled for tiller pegs and the fittings for mounting the Autopilot are on the stern deck. There are two strong points for attaching safety harnesses. The boom gallows are mounted on adjustable posts. The upper position allows for full standing headroom under the boom and the lower position is used for sailing. The cockpit is self-draining and there are removable oak gratings and a hatch giving access to the engine fuel filter and further storage space. The engine controls are recessed to avoid potential tangling with sheets. The cockpit tent and mainsail cover were new in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &#39;Deirdre&#39; has been rigged for single handed sailing. All halyards and control lines for the sails (except the topsail and potential spinnaker) lead aft to the cockpit and there are &ldquo;on/off&rdquo; cleats for the sheets. There are no winches fitted but the staysail and jibs have two part purchases and are easily controlled even in strong winds (there are two pairs of winches available if wanted!). As she is a &ldquo;classic boat&rdquo; there are no guardrails but permanent fore and aft safety lines are rigged on the cabin top and the foredeck to which a safety harness can be clipped.</p>","image_key":"Bmqvz3","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"American Redwood and Larch on Oak and Iroko","draft":0.9906,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":16,"head":12,"luff":12},"topsail":{"luff":14.25,"perpendicular":5.42},"length_overall":7.62,"calculated_thcf":0.914,"length_over_spars":10.0584,"fore_triangle_base":4.0386,"length_on_waterline":6.858,"fore_triangle_height":6.6294},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.62,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Deirdre&#39; (pronounced &#39;daredra&#39;) is a gaff cutter designed by Dennis Jacobs and built by Alexander Gostelow of Boston in 1935.

In 2007 she won the &lsquo;Cock of the Channel&rsquo; race. The Gafers Log article reproduced below incorrectly credits Maurice Griffiths with the design. It is possible Griffiths was involved with the Pin Mill built boats as both he and Hanna were yachting journalists. <h4>Cock o&rsquo; the Bristol Channel Cup: &lsquo;Rawanah&rsquo; takes honours<br />by John Cochrane<br />first published in Gaffers Log December, 2007</h4><blockquote>This event began back in 1936 as a race for the Bristol Channel pilot cutter owners who put up the Cock o&rsquo; the Bristol Channel challenge cup. Entry was restricted to pilot cutters and with all 46 winners engraved on the cup, there are some pretty well known names on display.</blockquote><blockquote>Organised by Barry Yacht Club in association with the Bristol Channel Pilot Cutters Owners Association it is now open to pilot cutters and all other gaff-rigged challengers. The 2007 event took place on the August Bank Holiday weekend and it is hoped to re-establish the race as an annual principal fixture in the Bristol Channel.</blockquote><blockquote>Proceedings began with a dinner on the Saturday evening with the start at 0700 hours on Sunday 26 August off the entrance to Barry. The course was nearly 80 miles, leaving the Horseshoe Buoy off Ilfracombe to starboard and likewise the West Scarweather Buoy off Swansea Bay. The finish was back at Barry YC in a line west to east. There were just four entrants, three BC pilot cutters &lsquo;Mascotte&#39;, &lsquo;Peggy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Olga&rsquo;, with the OGA represented by John Cochrane&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rawanah&#39;.</blockquote><blockquote>A Maurice Griffiths designed gaff ketch, &lsquo;Rawanah&#39; is a double ender built in 1935 at the request of a customer who wanted a boat able to be sailed single-handed around the coasts of North West Scotland.</blockquote><blockquote>At 35 feet, Rawanah was up against strong opposition and had been invited to join the race with a scratch crew from the Underfall Boat Yard in Bristol City Dock. We crossed the start line ahead of a fleet at 0700 hrs on a windless August Bank Holiday. The first mark, Horseshoe Buoy off Ilfracombe, was some 37 miles just south of west, the wind was meant to be from the NE but failed to show except in little puffs. The fleet stayed fairly compact though after eight hours &lsquo;Rawanah&#39; was in the lead, her lighter weight, 10 tons, and ease of switching sails to accommodate the puffs being in her favour. Soon the tide turned and we all had to anchor, &lsquo;Rawanah&#39; had stayed some 3 miles off the Devon Coast, the pilot cutters had positioned themselves much closer in.</blockquote><blockquote>Over the next four hours it appeared they had made the right choice as they were eventually seen inching up the coast whilst we were stuck in a 3 knot tide. So it was up anchor and sail to close on the fleet to get whatever was making their progress. No sooner had we taken up position behind them than the breeze fell and we all began to drift east on the tide, ending up a good mile behind our previous anchoring point.</blockquote><blockquote>The tide turns and the fleet, with us in the rear, move west, a very small zephyr aids us. We note Mascotte well in the lead but surprisingly not turning at the Horseshoe Buoy but appearing to head for Lundy in the grip of the tide, Peggy and Olga turned at the buoy and made for Swansea.<br />The light dims and we approach the Horseshoe at 1 knot plus tide going for the gap between the buoy and the overfalls some 4 cables to the south. When 2 cables off Horseshoe we are hit by a force 5 plus out of nowhere, the promised northeasterly had arrived.</blockquote><blockquote>The Underfall Crew got the topsail, yankee and large staysail down and replaced them with more appropriate cloth. In all the bustle we lost way and heading so went right through the overfalls. Rawanah is a good sea boat and with the new rig pulling took us through without a wave in the cockpit, though the foredeck crew had a cooling experience. Darkness fell and we rounded Horseshoe set a course for West Scar.</blockquote><blockquote>We could see the lights of one if not two of the fleet but they vanished before dawn. At around 0400 hrs we were only three cables off West Scar on our third attempt to make the buoy in ever shifting winds; I went below. The watch took a further three hours to round West Scar, every approach having been rendered useless by sudden and contrary wind shifts.</blockquote><blockquote>We crept eastwards, along the banks, but the tide turned and we had to anchor. By mid morning there was enough sea breeze, to beat the tide. Up went the sails all eight of them, for this was a &lsquo;boat on boat&rsquo; race, with no handicap rules to prevent on the spot imaginative sail plans. We knew the main fleet was ahead, and shortly learned that they had abandoned the race owing to time and motored in. Rawanah was the only boat to sail the course and 35 hours after the start, crossed the finish line with all eight sails still aloft and took the Honours. The underdogs from Underfall had prevailed. There are many ways to win a race, persistence being one of them.</blockquote><blockquote>Barry Yacht Club hope more old gaffers will join the fray next year. We have a title to defend so hope to be there. The Challenge Cup is magnificent almost dwarfing our smallest crew member, well worth trying to get your boat&rsquo;s name on it.</blockquote>","image_key":"v6gTDt","uk_part1":"164354","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel","draft":1.4996,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":14,"head":11.92,"luff":20.5},"mizzen":{"foot":10,"luff":20.58},"topsail":{"luff":17.5,"perpendicular":8},"length_overall":10.921,"calculated_thcf":1,"fore_triangle_base":5.2822,"length_on_waterline":9.525,"fore_triangle_height":9.7292},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.921,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"A Tahiti Ketch, one of at least two built by Harry King","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":3.301,"air_draft":null,"reference":["Log Dec 2007"],"builder":"63963d6b-c36a-4c35-9c0d-d42fb6cf4645","designer":"c4721fcb-96c6-463f-a516-3f206a95f6ba","design_class":"095e1bc1-a693-4a1e-86f8-0e97080dc730","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Tahiti Ketch"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"John G.

Following his return, and whilst in command of the torpedo boat destroyer &lsquo;Porcupine&rsquo; in 1906, he purchased &lsquo;Lona II&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OGA member Richard Meynell, who owned &#39;Lona II&#39; until 2005, received these two extracts from the Lieutenant&#39;s 1906 log from his grand-daughter, Susan Bell, nee Barne:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>Felixstowe Dock to Woodbridge in July 1906</strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In the morning I sailed from Felixstowe Dock, where I had anchored for the night, and arrived off the entrance to Bawdsey Haven, into which I had never before been, at about midday.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Scorning the assistance of a pilot, I thought to sail in without misadventure, by following what I took to be the channel, from the absence of breaking seas, the breeze being moderate, and blowing right in. Alas, my pride met its speedy reward, and I grounded and commenced working about in the shingle on the bar, but not bumping very badly, for which last mercy I was thankful.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The tide was flowing, so I laid the anchor out in what I discovered to be the proper channel, a few fathoms to the Northward of the place I had chosen. This proceeding was not unaccompanied by incident. Upon first grounding, I had made the dinghy fast under the bowsprit, as the yacht&rsquo;s stern had been to seaward, which had caused the dinghy to swing alongside and bump with the swell.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When I got on the bowsprit to get into the dinghy, I first cast off the painter and threw it into the boat, intending to follow it immediately. This last portion of my plan was frustrated, through the seat of my trousers having become firmly caught on the hook of the jib outhaul. Upon attempting, therefore, to leap into the dinghy, I found myself suspended in space and above the limpid waves by the seat of my nether garments. The dinghy meanwhile began to drift rapidly in over the bar, toward the haven being impelled by wind and tide. There was but one thing to do, and I did it, this was to struggle for my knife which was in my trousers pocket and cut away that portion of those garments by which I was attached to the bowsprit. I lost little time in cutting it away and when I had dropped into the sea I soon regained the truant dinghy. After some time, during which the yacht seemed to be set by the tide higher and higher up the knoll, she eventually swung to her anchor and I managed to sail in over the bar. I sailed successfully up to Woodbridge that evening carrying the jackyard topsail and the flood tide all the way, and on arrival there, having stowed up I landed and walked to Melton where I had supper with Lieutenant G Crispin and his sister.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>My misadventures were a topic of jovial discussion over our glass of port that evening!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>Saturday 20 August 1906</strong></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Having completed the purchase of &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; at Burnham on the 10th August, from Mr J Pain Clark, for the sum of &pound;250, I travelled from Portsmouth where I was in command of the torpedo boat destroyer &lsquo;Porcupine&rsquo; on the Friday night, finding &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; alongside King&rsquo;s stage at Burnham stored and ready for sea. As she would not be afloat until about 3am, I turned in, and was awakened at that hour by King&rsquo;s son-in-law. He came on board and assisted me to lay her off, and pick up a mooring, which we did under the roller foresail (the working sail), and he returned ashore until 5 o&rsquo;clock while I took the mainsail coat off, and got ready for sea.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There was a light SW breeze blowing and was all right for the Orwell, whither I was bound. At 5 o&rsquo;clock he came off and helped me to get under way. I shipped at a quarter past five, under plain sail, and sailed down the River Crouch in transports of delight and pride of my purchase, the first vessel having a deck that I had ever possessed.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Lona&rsquo; was only built for the previous season, 1905, and was the very latest and smartest thing in five ton cruisers, built by Messrs W. King and was to Mr Pain Clark&rsquo;s own design. She was built to stand heavy weather, having easy lines, moderate overhang with a spoon bow and a flush deck, with small cockpit giving access to the cabin. Her topsides were of teak, bottom of elm and pitch pine, timbers of English oak and deck of Kauri pine.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She had a fir pole-mast with roller reefing mainsail and roller foresail. The deck fittings, cockpit etc were of teak and all finished in the best possible manner. She was metal fastened throughout, with a lead keel and no inside ballast. In her coat of glossy black enamel with white boot top and gilt ribbon, with well cleaned spars, she was the most beautiful little picture of a yacht that could be imagined, and I was indeed proud of her.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I gave myself and the deck a wash down as I went and, when in the neighbourhood of the NW Buxey buoy, I shifted the jib head topsail for the jackyard and topsail and squared away again for Harwich. The breeze freshened when I was off the Naze but, as it was fair, I hung on to the jackyarder and got into Harwich harbour at about four.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When in the Orwell, I hove to and took in the topsail and pursued my way up the river against the ebb tide, hoping to get to Ipswich, where I intended to leave her until I could get some leave.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The wind fell very light and I was just making a little way over the tide when, not being acquainted with the buoyage of the river and foolishly not allowing sufficient room, I ran on the middle ground, which, as those who know the Orwell will testify, is right off the outfall of the Ipswich sewer.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I was soon aware of this fact, the aroma from the mud flats, as the tide fell, being almost overpowering. I had myself to thank entirely for the misadventure and resolved to pay more regard to the buoyage. I discovered, at low water, that the tide recedes below the buoys by several feet, leaving them high and dry. (In spite of these resolutions, however, I managed to get aground in the Orwell upon countless occasions, both in subsequent cruises in &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; and &lsquo;Winifred&rsquo;).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>As the tide left her she took a heavy list to starboard and while laying out the anchor in the dinghy, I had opportunity to admire her delightfully and charmingly symmetrical proportions, both above and below the water line. During the night the wind arose and by morning it was blowing &lsquo;great guns&rsquo;.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In the small hours, before the &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; was afloat, I thought it would be a good idea to make myself a strong brew of tea. Acting upon this decision I groped in the pantry locker, (the only light being provided by the &lsquo;Beatrice&rsquo; cooking stove) and finding a tin of the size and shape of that in which I know the tea to be stowed, I poured a good quantity of its contents into the kettle when it was boiling. When it was cool enough to drink, I took a long and lusty pull at it, having added to it some condensed milk and sugar, and then longed heartily for the surrounding mud to rise and choke me and put me out of my misery &ndash; the &lsquo;tea&rsquo; that I had poured into the kettle was no less than a quantity of Sam Clark&rsquo;s rather dry, strong, tobacco!!!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When I recovered, I thought it time to be getting under way, the &lsquo;Lona&rsquo; being afloat. The wind was South West and any amount of it. I went up under the foresail and let go the anchor below the Bight, just above the Bathing and Rowing Club, which was on the weather shore. She quickly dragged her anchor across the river and took the ground off the . . .</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>And there unfortunately Michael Barne&rsquo;s narrative comes to an end.</blockquote>","image_key":"JDZbTh","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel pitch pine below water, teak above on oak","draft":1.7008,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":20,"head":14,"luff":15},"topsail":{"luff":18,"perpendicular":7.5},"length_overall":9.7536,"calculated_thcf":1.015,"fore_triangle_base":4.8768,"length_on_waterline":7.4676,"fore_triangle_height":7.4676},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.7536,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Lona II&#39; is a miniature racing yacht of the period.

There is ample storage on shelves and in lockers under the berths and in the galley and heads. &nbsp;A Taylor&rsquo;s paraffin cabin heater adds comfort on chillier evenings. &nbsp;Forward of the main cabin, in the fore cabin where there is sitting headroom, are two further full-length berths with storage lockers underneath. &nbsp;From here there is an opening hatch to the deck and access to the chain locker. &nbsp;Each berth is equipped with an LED reading light.</p><p>The steps down into the main cabin can be lifted out to give access to the recent Vetus M2-D5 13hp diesel engine that has run about 700 hours and is in excellent condition. &nbsp;At 2000rpm this gives a speed of 5 knots in smooth water. &nbsp;As well as providing motive power the engine charges two lead-acid batteries, one dedicated to engine starting and the other for lighting and instrumentation. &nbsp;The engine control panel, which includes a rev counter and oil pressure gauge, is fitted in a recess in the cockpit.</p><p>Navigation equipment includes steering and hand bearing compasses, NASA Clipper wind, speed and depth instruments, a Garmin 126 GPS and a Yeoman Sport chart plotter that uses A2 size Admiralty Leisure charts. &nbsp;The GPS and plotter are linked together to provide a really versatile facility whereby, for example, waypoints marked on the chart can be instantly transferred to the GPS display in the cockpit, and the current GPS position is constantly available on the chart. &nbsp;The GPS is also permanently linked to the NASA SX35 DSC VHF set to provide positional information in the event of an emergency. &nbsp;A NASA Navtex receiver is also fitted.</p><p>Deck gear includes all necessary warps and fenders, a 26lb CQR with and a Danforth kedge both with ground chains and nylon cables. &nbsp;A 1.8m Plastimo rowing inflatable can be stowed deflated on deck or towed astern. &nbsp;There is a horseshoe lifebuoy and two cockpit seat cushions that can also provide emergency flotation. &nbsp;Fire extinguishers to BSS standards are fitted.","image_key":"NTjRcP","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":"Wood","construction_details":"GRP hull, ply/timber topsides","draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":12.5,"head":9,"luff":17.5},"topsail":{"luff":10.33,"perpendicular":6.17},"length_overall":7.2634,"calculated_thcf":0.901,"length_over_spars":9.144,"fore_triangle_base":4.0386,"length_on_waterline":6.4526,"fore_triangle_height":7.1628},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.2634,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"A fine example of a Tamarisk 24 class topsail gaff cutter.","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"http://cokerwood.webplus.net/","beam":2.4384,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"d5e823a5-467d-4edb-a167-6cdfd1e23c8c","designer":"248b3a1a-e45d-4490-8de7-aaa23ab100b9","design_class":"ddbf9499-7c46-4f21-ac92-9d87c65e40ab","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Tamarisk 24"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"David M.

Main is slab reefed with 2 points. Blue mainsail cover 2014. Jib and staysail are both on Wycombe Martin furlers. Heavy duty high cut hank on gib which has never been used.&nbsp;Top sail is blue and white striped &nbsp;(2014) flown from a windsurfer mast which is deployed very easily. When not in use the sail remains bent onto the windsurfer mast and is lashed to the boom. Light weather down wind sail flies from the bowsprit. This is in fact an old spinnaker but it does the job well. Halyards and sheets were mainly all replaced 2014 - 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Engine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vetus M20 professionally serviced each year and it&#39;s never missed a beat. New control panel fitted 2016. I would guess that the stainless tank holds around 25 gallons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cabin and accommodation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Estren&#39; is very comfortable has good headroom down below (5&#39;10) at best. The bunk cushions were reupholstered 2017.&nbsp;In the saloon there is a newly constructed solid teak side facing chart table to port, with good storage below, and a 6&#39;3&quot; berth with lee cloth. Shelving above, storage below. Forward of this is a hanging locker. To port is&nbsp;the galley with stainless sink with solid brass faucet. There is a 2016 flexible 50 litre water tank under the starboard berth and water is pumped to the sink via a foot pump. There is a small solid brass bilge type pump along side the sink which drains it. Next to the sink is an excellent 2 burner spirit (2017) stove which will bring a kettle to boil in almost the same time as gas. Forward of the galley is a berth which my friend of 6&#39; 1&quot; sleeps happily in. Shelving above, storage below. There is&nbsp;traditional electric lighting and two oil lamps. There is a solid teak folding table which stows in the forepeak and can be used in the saloon or cockpit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the forepeak there is a single berth at 5&#39;10&#39; (but no taller). At the aft end the cushion can be removed to reveal the Blakes sea toilet. Shelf to port where I store the beaching legs and sail lockers below the berth.&nbsp;There is a door to this cabin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruce anchor which is perfect for this area and has&nbsp;held her firm in a number of gales. 10 metes of chain and 30 meters of warp. There is also a small kedge anchor which I&#39;ve yet to use. Nassa depth, and a new (2016) Clipper wind wireless from the sender at the top of the mast so no cable. It has its own small solar charger so no&nbsp;power or batteries required. There is also a 2016 Raymarine ST1000 tiller pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brass oil nav. lights for port and starboard which attach&nbsp;to wooden brackets on the shrouds. I also have a set of battery nav. lights.</p>","image_key":"ZVfF5M","uk_part1":"711988","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"GRP with ply deck","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":16,"head":12,"luff":14.5},"topsail":{"luff":18,"perpendicular":6.25},"length_overall":7.1628,"calculated_thcf":0.913,"fore_triangle_base":4.4196,"length_on_waterline":6.7056,"fore_triangle_height":6.9342},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":7.1628,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":2.4384,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"3bce15f6-ee0f-46a9-a70d-a8cead71eda4","designer":"7ac480da-7d09-4dd7-9c89-61199ff30913","design_class":"6f0aa06a-98b0-4764-8e61-d789bcfb63f0","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Heard 23"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Percy Dalton"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Cutter"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Gaffers and Luggers","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[{"asking_price":12950,"flexibility":"normal","offered":null,"price_flexibility":{"text":"normal"},"reduced":false,"sales_text":"<p>\"Estren\" is a&nbsp;Heard 23 based in Dartmouth.

Originally called&nbsp;a Mayfly Corsaire (Demonstrator no 2) she is now known as an Oystercatcher 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She sleeps three in the cabin&nbsp;(and two outside in the cockpit!) and is fitted with a sea toilet and small galley. The interior was&nbsp;professionally fitted and finished during original construction and uses hardwoods and sapele faced ply. There are ample cave lockers and a forward, deep sail locker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in 1997 as a cutter,&nbsp;at some point the mast was moved forward to convert her to a sloop. A Yanmar&nbsp;engine was fitted in 2003 and she was mainly used under power in the Plymouth Sound by her owner at that time. David Botterill purchased her in 2007 from Barbican Yacht Agency and had her fitted with a sea toilet in the vacant heads and waste water seacock for the galley. In 2008 James Lawrence made her a new headsail&nbsp;and modified the existing mainsail to give more height in the cockpit. They also supplied new&nbsp;running rigging. Tony MacKillican made a new tiller. She proved to be an excellent sea boat and she cruised in the Bristol Channel and&nbsp;spent three summers in the Milford Haven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 she underwent a complete repaint of the hull and topsides including coppercoat antifoul and non-slip finish on&nbsp;repainted deck and cockpit. All to&nbsp;high professional standards courtesy of Dave Freemantle at Cardiff Marine. Her exterior hardwood was stripped back and treated with International Woodskin. All&nbsp;standing rigging was replaced. A new cabin sole was cut in Robbins teak veneer. The boom was extended by 2&#39; at the goose neck to effect an overhang on the transom (it didn&#39;t previously as a result of the mast being moved forward and was consequently a bit difficult to stash in a marina or on a pontoon) and James Lawrence made a new mainsail&nbsp;to take account of her new dimensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She did have&nbsp;a lovely boom crutch made from recycled pine gym bars (that also suppied the extra two foot of boom shaped, and epoxied by Dennis). Unfortunatelty they twisted and snapped in a storm in late 2019 finally prompting me to design and have fabricated a galvanised version.&nbsp;If anything, she is better balanced on the tiller under sail than before as a result of the changes to the boom length and the beautiful new mainsail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 she was on a river mooring in Keyhaven and sailed in the Solent during that glorious summer to attend the OGA 50 Rally at Cowes. Her photo shows Denis, my sailing buddy, and David Botterill, on the OGA Bristol Channel &#39;Up Channel&#39; Cruise&nbsp;in June 2014 just off the Port of Cardiff. Since the photograph I have added an anchor housing on the bowsprit enabling easier launch and retreival of a Delta anchor. In 2017 Rudders Yard&nbsp;upgraded her power source with a fixed solar panel and auxillary battery wired through a new power switch. A new conrol lever and cable was fitted by the yard in 2018, along with fittings for a new tiller pilot. In the last few months I have continued to make her more friendly for single handed sailing with all halyards and reefing lines leading to the cockpit. The topping lift leads to a cleat on the starboard cabin roof, the throat and gaff halyard feed through a new Barton deck organiser and a pair of clutches on the port side.</p>","image_key":"f7HXWW","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":null,"draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":14,"head":9,"luff":10},"topsail":{"luff":9,"perpendicular":2},"sailarea":7,"length_overall":6.096,"calculated_thcf":0.829,"fore_triangle_base":2.4384,"length_on_waterline":5.715,"fore_triangle_height":6.4008},"hull_form":"unknown","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":6.096,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>Built in 1997, &#39;Charlie&#39; is&nbsp;of GRP construction in the hull and decks, with extensive use of hardwood finishes. &#39;Charlie&#39;s&#39; home port is&nbsp;the Cardiff Bay Yacht Club in Cardiff Bay.</p>","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":2.4384,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"2a625108-bef9-404e-bf02-4aad488efa47","designer":"0a7e6fb2-e0ca-4d35-b34c-367dfb4d9056","design_class":"2e74e933-b6b6-419b-95b4-ca0ffedea264","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Oystercatcher 20"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"Bryan Gibson"},"rigTypeByRigType":{"name":"Sloop"},"genericTypeByGenericType":{"name":"Yacht"},"builderByBuilder":{"name":"Mayfly Classic Boats","notes":null},"for_sale_state":{"text":"not_for_sale"},"for_sales":[],"engine_installations":[]}}}}

He was a keen Old Gaffer racing man, who having sailed several types of gaffer decided he could design and build one better and faster. It took him 5 years and there is an album of photographs that records the whole process. Time was not of the essence and great care was given to the constructin and the detai work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boat was built using West Epoxy System and BS 1088 marine ply, with teak laid decks and teak and mahogany exterior fit out. The shape is very conventional with a long keel, straight stem, good freeboard and multichine. She has&nbsp; a generous interior volume. She is fairly full mid-ships producing ample buoyancy so she stands up to her canvas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chines land on a full length internal stringer and there are a number of heavy laminated rig frames which span across the centre-line.

The forward and after ends of the sheer strake have &quot;badges&quot; carved and picked out in paint against the varnish. The fore foot is very square giving her grip in the water and directional stability and the transom has a delicate tumble-home to the upper edges. The transom-hung rudder has a step in it allowing someone in the water to climb back aboard.</font></font></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\"><font face=\"Helvetica\" size=\"2\">Heavy galvanised steel centre-plate incorporated into the companionway step and stowed in the raised position within the depth of the wood keel.

The cabin entrance with sliding hatch and wash-boards has a sill at seat level. The deck is swept-laid in teak over a ply sub deck. The rig is set up with halyards led aft along the coach-roof deck through clutches to a top-action Harken 9 winch each side of the entrance hatch.

Following a major restoration, starting in 2007, much of the hull has been repaired or replaced, including the deck.

Occasionally there was evidence that some work had been done on her, and in 1965 her then owner, David Garber was persuaded to join the OGA, and we looked forward to seeing her sailing. But it was not to be. In 1969 she was bought by David Robertson Hiner of Maldon, and things happened. David got her into sailing trim, and in 1970 he entered her for our East Coast Race, but she did not start. On the 16th September that year, David sold her to Thomas Alexander Corbett, who owned her until the 9th February 1975, when she was sold to Andrew Ross Wheatley. On November 25th 1975, Ian Ferderick Kiloh bought her from Wheatley.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Yes, my &lsquo;Cachalot&rsquo;, is indeed the same as owned by David and yes, we&rsquo;ve had a major task involving new carlins, doubling up the main beam (which was broken), new covering boards, several new half beams, new bulwarks, hatches, cabin trunking, interior, the list goes on, and on . . .</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>However, the end is at least in sight and although we do not expect her to be really A1 until next year we anticipate having our first sail in her in May this year, all going to plan. She is a really lovely little yacht and has been well worth all the effort. My wife and I purchased her in November 1975 in Wivenhoe after her having been sunk - and run over by a coaster!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>One interesting thing we have found is the original advertisement as placed in the Yachtsman of October 1897 by her builder offering her up for sale. Interestingly she was &lsquo;almost &lsquo;completed&rsquo; then, yet registered in 1904 as being built in 1900. She appears in Lloyd&#39;s Register in 1902.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Her first sails were by English, and purchased in 1902. We think that probably the Boer War accounts for the anomolies. The builder/designer did in fact own a timber yard - I think his claim of &lsquo;built of best materials&rsquo; is the reason she is still around today as her last ten years or so seem to have treated her very unkindly. I would be most grateful for any information as to her earlier history; and I would be delighted if any OGA members have information on the efficiency of either Cascover sheathing or Admiralty &lsquo;Impetite&rsquo;.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h4>First published in the Old Gaffers Association Newsletter 1977/3</h4>","image_key":"7w4vX9","uk_part1":"120778","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel Pitch pine/Teak on oak","draft":1.524,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":22,"head":10,"luff":12.83},"sailarea":11,"length_overall":9.1958,"calculated_thcf":0.903,"length_over_spars":9.4488,"fore_triangle_base":8.891,"length_on_waterline":7.0104,"fore_triangle_height":6.9586},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":9.1958,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>Cachalot is a gaff cutter built along similar lines to that of an East Coast smack.

During that summer she deterioated and there was a threat to break her up so he decided to put in a low offer which was accepted. He then had to get her back to his home at Bembridge. He stopped up seams that had opened, checked all the seacocks, refurbished the hand pump and put a portable petrol pump on board and she was towed there by the old, Attrill&#39;s built, Bembridge harbour ferry. The trip went well she hardly leakd at all. he has carried out a careful detailed restoration and he has detailed it all carefully.

They plan to re-make all of the spars: two new masts, two booms, a gaff, a topmast, and a bowsprit! Once the hull is sound, and re-ballasted, and the new spars made, they will replace all the rigging, and re-fit the interior.

Laura is a little deeper draftedthan a trawler of the same length but the fishing grounds worked out of Fleetwood and Douglas would allow for this.\r\n\r\nLaura appeared as a subject of a book, written by Edward Delmar- Morgan in the early 1950's. He probably bought her in 1950 or 1951 as the book describes her refit and first cruise she made to France before the book was published in 1954. She was Bermudan rigged then with a substantial coach roof and fitted with a wing engine. Laura was in a rundown state when Delmar-Morgan found her, so he motored her round to Portsmouth Harbour for a thorough refit. Most of the work seems to have been cosmetic. An accident occurred that showed she was still using her original beaching legs that fastened to a large eyebolt through the beam shelf and deck. One of these pulled through the deck causing a fair amount of real work on top of addressing the effects of the neglect.\r\n\r\nLaura knocked around the south coast during the next 30 years, to be found, still with her Bermudan Rig.Laura was bought by Bill Sissons in 1980. She sailed in the seasons of 1980 and 1981 and was then laid up in a mud berth. Gayle Heard the sail maker helped bring her round to the Blackwater. He was looking for a fast boat and was so impressed he bought her in 1985. he then undertook a 6 year total re-build, all frames were replaced with steamed timbers. By replacing the cast iron keelson and concrete ballast with lead, her headroom was improved. She was returned to gaff rig with hollow spars and a new suit of sails. The rebuild was not complete as she has 90% of her planking, her keel and sternpost. Port and starboard top strakes were replaced and stringers were inserted to stiffen her up. The deck and above is all new. The rebuild was finished in 1991 and she raced very successfully for the next 10 years.\r\n\r\nBought & returned to Fleetwood 2001 New owner donated copy of lines and survey.

She supposedly had her inspiration from an 80' Mylne ketch, and while her sheer line and ends show this inspiration her broad beam and centreboard are a practical response to the demands of British coastal cruising. Her hull construction is inch and a quarter mahogany glued and screwed on laminated mahogany frames, with laminated mahogany ring frames in way of her masts.<p>Glassed below the waterline, she has a teak deck over marine ply, and a wooden centreboard within ballast keel. Her hull was built to a high standard by Lathams in Poole, and she was finished by Mark Varvill in West Wittering before her launch in Birdham Pool in 1998, under her original name of Diligent II.<p>She was originally fitted out more or less as a day sailer, with an engine but almost no electronics and no winches. Everything was done with tackles. Varvill very sadly died prematurely, after having seen the boat winning her class in the 2001 Jubilee Regatta Round the Island Race. The boat was bought by Peter Muir who commissioned a thorough refit by Berthons for world cruising, including winches and a bow thruster, which makes her a very practical family boat, easily sailed by her very average husband and wife team.<p>On the other hand, when in regatta mode, her full complement of seven upwind sails means that a crew of a dozen can each have their own string! She was accidentally bought by Ed &amp; Frances Maggs, &ldquo;We didn't mean to buy a Gaffer&rdquo;, during a boatless summer caused by breaking the mast of their Stella in summer 2011. The boat, in a manoeuvre many &#39;owners&#39; will be familiar with, rather stuck her paw out at them from between the bars of the Lymington Boat's Home, and adopted them as her new parents. So far they have been delighted with her, and their only regret is that work has not yet allowed them to undertake the long cruise they dream of: cruising was initially limited to their home waters of the East Coast, Netherlands, Orkney, Cornwall, Channel Islands and Brittany.<p>More recently she has been undertaking a slow exploration of the West Coast of Ireland.

After the war she reappears belonging to Captain Bond, Liverpool and in 1926 was sold to the Earl of Derby. He lent her to the Royal Navy in the 1930s for the training of midshipmen on HMS Eaglet. From 1939 onwards, Deva was owned by &#39;mere commoners&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of her original structure survived for the best part of a century, probably due to regular maintenance and use. She has pitch pine planking on oak frames.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deva is an ex Royal Mersea Rivers Class, built 1912 by Crossfield of Arnside. The Rivers Class were Crossfields smallest prawners fitted out as open racing boats for the &#39;Liverpool gentlemen&#39;. The Rivers Class differed from the working boats only in details of rig.The boom was longer and the sails were of cotton as opposed to tarred canvas, and they were rigged as sloops instead of cutter. Several of the class were built, possibly as many as 30, all named after rivers, Mersea was the first (and the fastest) followed by Deva, Thames, Styx, Severn etc. The Class was active up to about 1935, when it was disbanded. Several of the Class went to join their working sisters in the pursuit of shrimps and prawns in Liverpool Bay and off North Wales. Others have ended up as Bermudan rigged sloops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deva returned to racing for Tranmere Yacht Club in 1956. Her owner, Harry Williams of Rock Ferry, a shipwright, redecked her and added a cabin. Deva was very successful against modern competition. One of her more notable achievements was gaining third place in the local Isle of Man midnight race against a Nor`wester. Her owner locked his seasick crew below for 17 hours while he sailed the race single-handed, or so the locals say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after this, Mr. Williams sold Deva to Mr. Wainwright and she was sunk in the River Mersea by a dredger.

She is strongly built with pine planking on an oak frame with an iron keel and a good deal of lead ballast. Her main cabin is cavernous for such a tiny boat. Part of this stems from the extension of the hull upwards to form the cabin sides. Griffith goes on to say &quot;Perhaps the most striking feature of this experimental design is the fullness of the hull, the pronounced tumblehome of the topsides from amidships aft, and the enormous quarters, which appear to be based on those of the French crabbers.&quot;</p><p>Robinetta is mostly original. Significant changes were made by Mike Garnham who replaced the previous engine by the current Yanmar 1GM10 and re-worked the cockpit.

She was first registered in Plymouth in 1891 as PH 302. She is an early example of a Plymouth Hooker. She fished out of Polperro and other West Country ports until 1949 when she was sold as a yacht for the sum of &pound;185, a Willy&#39;s jeep (Teg. FDv 64) and a book of petrol coupons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1951 a survey shows she was partly decked with an open cockpit and a 1925 1 cylinder Bergius Co. engine. By 1958 she had a 19472 cylinder Thornecroft engine. In the mid 1970s she had a 20hp air cooled Lister engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979 Jim Curry refitted her including full decking, replacing parts of the keel, the stem and some replanking, tripling some frames and building a coachroof. Research at that time included a conversation with a 92 year old gent who remembered fishing on Spinaway in his youth. He had a fragile photograph of her and he quoted her as being the fastest piece of wood out of Polperro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996 Dave Blinkhorn interviewed JC Heal&#39;s son Philip and got some of the above information. He described her as a Looe Lugger. As a yacht she has spent time in the Irish Sea, and in Dave and Anna Blinkhorn&#39;s ownership sailed via Scotland, East Coast and the French Canals to the Mediterranean, ending up in Spain. She sailed back to the West Country in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, Bob Aylott went sailing with her owners Andrew and Angela Hitt and crew Mike and Brian on the River Medina.

He is a Harbour Master at Woolverstone Marina on the river Orwell near Ipswich. He acquired her from Brian Humby who bought her in 1955 when she was laid up in a mud birth at Bucklers Hard. The process of buying her and sailing her to the Orwell was part of his honeymoon. Brian was a teacher in Ipswich. He was her custodian for some for 47 years and kept her at Pin Mill where he was a member of the Pin Mill Sailing Club. There is a good painting of Gwenili in the club house and her name is inscribed on Club cups. Brian and the boat were well know sailing characters in these waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially a cruising vessel, Brian kept her sailing with his young family as he made trips around the East Anglian coast, Dutch waters, the Channel Isles, the Scillies and the Western Isles. He looked after her very well and kept her sailing every year except 1971 when he undertook major work replacing the rusted away steel strap floors with heavy oak floors which stopped her leaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1984 her worn out Thornycroft 2cyl Handy Billy was replaced by a 38hp BMC diesel. Brian and his wife was sailing her well into his 80s. Brian had no information of the previous owner, I did meet up with his son who sailed with his father and is the chief Harbour Master at Wooverstone Marina who said the owner was in the RAF and the boat might have formally been called &#39;Piros&#39;. In his time Brian changed the sails to tan and spars were painted with white tips to give her the appearance of a working boat on the east coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Feb 2007 I participated in the Frost Bite race on the river Thames and a photo appeared in Classic Boat of Gwenili. I was then contacted via the editor by Michael Godley who thought he recognised the photo of Gwenili as a boat he crewed on in the summer of 1939 when he was 14. By exchange of photos we established it was the same vessel. He informed me that she was owned by Michael Fellowes who was in his early twenties. He had met them at Belsay Castle in Northumberland as a guest of Mrs Middleton. So in the summer of 1939 while sailing in Britany they had to return in a hurry as war had been declared and they rushed to join up, Michael and Michael Fellows both joined the RAF. The owner&#39;s father was Air Commodore Fellowes who in 1933 led the first successful flight over Everest. Michael also wrote a log and took photos of his sailing holiday to Brittany which I have copies of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent times I have been sailing on the UK East Coast participating In OGA rally events, Holland and North France. I have maintained a programme of restoration to keep her up to scratch. In 2007 I improved her sail area and fitted new sails which has made a considerable improvement to her sailing performance and handling as well as improving her deck and gunwale. I have also made every effort to return her appearance to a cruising yacht with her rather fine and elegant lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has undergone fairly major works at St Osyth Boatyard working with Shipwright Alan Williams including new stem, starboard garboard and strake above, new rudder and propeller, re-caulking and re-fastening where required and new engine sump,diesel and water tanks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2011 I replaced the old BBC 1500 Engine with its attendant oil leaks for a 37hp Nannie/ Kabuto Engine. Half the physical size with twice the power, this has been a considerable success increased my cruising range by 50/50 sailing. Also the reduction of the engine size in the doghouse and has inspired me to consider increasing the size of the cockpit creating more room, comfort and all round vision when sailing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the winter of 2012 at St Osyth Boat Yard we undertook extensive maintenance work including two thirds re-caulking, replaced half plank below waterline on port side, planking repair on starboard side above waterline. We also refastened hood ends at the stern, refastened and re-galvanized all chain plates, repainted four coats all round and made repairs to cabin beams and coamings. Finally we fitted a new doghouse and cockpit, re-paying all deck seams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have found out more about her early French history and when she first came under the British Flag and I have a log and photos by Michael Godley at Carantec Brittany August 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer 2012 I sailed to the west coast of France, including Brest and Douarnenez Festival, then down to Bordeaux via La Rochelle. Gwenili over-wintered in La Rochelle as I unfortunately contracted cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, having recovered from my illness, I sailed her back to Brightlingsea in August via Cowes and the OGA50 celebrations. In 2014, I sailed Gwenili to the Netherlands to take part in the Dutch Anniversary Tour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015 Gwenili returned to France, in company with several other OGA members from the Netherlands and UK to celebrate in St Malo with the Vieux Greements de France. Following on from this, we took part in the Branlebas Regatta. As well as the Groupe Giboire trophy for 2<sup>nd</sup> place, Gwenili received a special award:&nbsp;Troph&eacute;e Raymond Labb&eacute;&nbsp; in recognition of her overall performance, classic lines and restoration. Martin Goodrich went to France to receive his award on 2 December 2015.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","image_key":"Zvb8vP","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel pine on oak.

These lengths were then extended to the required length using a home-made scarf engine to produce very efficient joints. The mast is hollow to allow for electric service cables to be carried to the top. The mast is held by a tabernacle and is capable of being lowered and raised by a septuagenarian crew. The bowsprit can be raised so as to reduce overall length and thus minimise mooring fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internally the bulkheads etc. have been completed using tongue and groove teak battens.

The length required was obtained by scarf jointing &quot;2x1&quot; battens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine is a Beta diesel of 14 h.p., driving a fixed three bladed propeller.

The sails were made by Goacher sails of Windermere. They comprise a mainsail, a staysail and a jib.

She is now sailed from the Royal Northumberland Yacht Club at Blyth or the Royal Quays Marina in North Shields on the River Tyne.&nbsp;Modest summer cruises over that time have taken her across the channel to Cherbourg and Alderney as well as west as far as Dartmouth and Salcombe. Anchoring in Newton River being a favourite on many a weekend. More recently she has cruised the north east coat between&nbsp; Whitby and Eyemouth. For health reasons she is now only day sailed.&nbsp;She has been a big part of the owners life since he was 8 years old and he has been sailing her alone since his late teens. She was also the reason he chose a career in ship design and shipbuilding. He lived onboard during his formative years working at a Southampton shipyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is a King Cole Class motor sailor (Sail No.1)&nbsp;and the only boat&nbsp;of that class known to the owner. There is a reference to the class in the 1964 Bristows Book of Yachts. There the&nbsp;builder is given&nbsp;as&nbsp;Kingcraft (Boatbuilders) Ltd. and at&nbsp;a cost of&nbsp;&pound;3995. She is formally listed as being built by Kingcraft but they do&nbsp;not appear in the list of builders in the back of Lloyds Register of Yachts. Her&nbsp;owner, Dr Peter N.H.&nbsp;Wright BEng PhD CEng MRINA,&nbsp;had the great privilege&nbsp;to&nbsp;corresponded&nbsp;with Alan Buchanan as a fellow Naval Architect. This&nbsp;provided further detail about her&nbsp;design but not about her builder. Extensive local research by Geoff Edwards&nbsp;from Burnham Museum has resolved this&nbsp;question. It was discovered that the first owner, Henry&nbsp;Town, commissioned her to be built by Alan F. Platt and Colin Nightingale on some land he rented for the purpose at the back of Hadleigh Iron Works. When she was completed she was taken by road round to Burnham and was launched at Rice and Cole Ltd.&#39;s yard in 1961. She was the first boat Alan Platt built after completing his apprenticeship and returning from National Service. Her owner has spoken to Alan Platt. He particularly&nbsp;recalled&nbsp;the Kelvin engine&nbsp;and&nbsp;rowing&nbsp;out to her mooring at Burnham to carry out maintenance over the first couple of seasons.&nbsp;As well as being an estate agent in Burnham, Henry Town was also a director of a cabinet making company called Kingcraft, hence the name he used for the builder when registering her. This also&nbsp;explained&nbsp;his ability to source good boatbuilding&nbsp;timber.&nbsp;He later diversified more formally&nbsp;into boatbuilding under the name of Kingcraft (Boatbuilding) Ltd. He kept Pied Piper until 1964&nbsp;when he ordered a&nbsp;Buchanan Saxon Class Sloop named&nbsp;Reina Christina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pied Piper still has her original Bergius Kelvin P4 diesel that produces&nbsp;20 SHP at 1200 RPM. It&nbsp;pushes her along very well and economically.&nbsp;It was lifted out of the boat in the mid 1990&#39;s to renew the keel bolts beneath it&nbsp;and the opportunity was taken to strip the engine down. It&nbsp;was found pistons, valve stems and guides etc. were still within Kelvin&#39;s stated tolerances. New rings and one new cylinder liner were fitted&nbsp;as well&nbsp;a&nbsp;Martec&nbsp;heat exchanger. This&nbsp;was installed to stop further degradation to the seats of the cylinder liner seals due to direct raw water cooling.&nbsp;The Kelvin stern&nbsp;gear,&nbsp;bronze throttle and characteristic astern wheel&nbsp;are all&nbsp;original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been a life long commitment, through thick and thin, to keep the boat up together and sailing. To this end she has been maintained very&nbsp;carefully by the owner and his father&nbsp;during their&nbsp;long combined ownership. Keel bolts, floor bolts and other fastenings have been replaced as needed. A length of the sheer strake and cover board on the aft port quarter were replaced in 1990&rsquo;s by the Maritime Workshop in Gosport.&nbsp;The only significant changes made were to replace, out of necessity, the fore hatch, the Dorade boxes and toe rail soon after she was&nbsp;bought by the father&nbsp;of the current owner in 1976.&nbsp;The mast, boom and most deck fittings are original. The finish on the spars and all the bright work has been gradually changed over to Coelan.&nbsp;When recently stripping the bottom back to bare wood, for the first&nbsp;time since 1978, the&nbsp;planking, stem, garboards, keelson and stern post were said to be&nbsp;as bright as when she was built. The owner reports the&nbsp;bilges remain dry even when she is sailed hard.</p>","image_key":"TVb8ns","uk_part1":"303601","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel - mahogany on canadian rock elm, copper fastened with teak decks and beams, iroko transom and stem, mahogany bilge stringer, bean stringer and clamp.

Her new owner added a doghouse, and reduced&nbsp;the length of her bowsprit, but he was obviously pleased with her as he replaced her original W.D.Fair petrol engine with a new Stuart Turner in 1948 and&nbsp;kept her until 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her next&nbsp;owner Edwin Ker sailed Crystal single handed back to Scotland via the Forth and Clyde Canal&nbsp;and kept her first at Rothesay, then Tighnabruich, and latterly at Oban. He sailed her for long periods each summer from 1957 to the mid 1970s, going&nbsp;as far north as Stornaway, and habitually&nbsp;sailed&nbsp;round Kintyre rather than through the Crinan Canal. He&nbsp;preferred not to use the engine and&nbsp;in early days he often sailed alone, but latterly with various crew, either friends or undergraduated found for him by various means. One regular source of crew was his friend Sir Charles Evans, principal of University College of North Wales, Bangor. Crystal was also lent out to friends from the UK and Vancouver where her owner&nbsp;had spent time between the wars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crystal was based for most of this time at Jimmy Smith&#39;s Yard at Tighnabruich, but after the yard closed in the mid 1970s Crystal was moved to Oban, where she had a mooring on the Brandy Stone moorings in the Sound of Kerrera. Edwin was in his 80s at this point and Crystal&#39;s standard of maintenance declined with some of her equipment (including her stay sail) being lost or stolen. Latterly Crystal was only rigged briefly each summer so friends and family could use her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Edwin Ker&#39;s death in 1980 Crystal was sold to two&nbsp;of her old &quot;student&quot; crew, and she moved to South Shian, Argyll. Her Stuart&nbsp;Turner engine was replaced by a Yanmar in&nbsp;1994, and her original, and now leaking, teak decks were replaced with glassed ply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually maintaining a wooden boat proved too much, and Crystal was sold again. She was brought&nbsp;back to Essex on a road trailer and underwent a&nbsp;renovation which may have seen her with a new mast and certainly saw the&nbsp;removal of&nbsp;her 1930&#39;s doghouse.

After a change of owner in the late 1960s she was neglected, sunk by a paint float from Falmouth Docks and subsequently salvaged to Penryn Creek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1970 she was transported by road and ferry to Guernsey and got sailing again. From 1973 she was based at Ferrybridge, Portland Harbour, back under the name &#39;Little Apple&#39;. She was the first winner of the Edgar March memorial trophy. A feat repeated some years later. She was at the first Bucktrout and St Malo Rally in 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979 the cabin top was added.

Famous now for being the year of &lsquo;The Squall&rsquo;, the race to Portsmouth showed us we had some significant stowage issues. In a nutshell, despite best efforts everything we owned ended up on the saloon floor en route. So it ended up being three weeks later and not the planned one that we finally sailed away, without much fanfare, from our home port of Marchwood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took a lot of hard work and some ingenious stowing but on 17th September we ventured out into the Solent bound for Lymington, and made it as far as Newport. A few days later we bade farewell to Iain&rsquo;s parents at Lymington, and headed west. It was only once we were through the Needles Channel on that flat-calm early morning that we really felt we were on our way and finally out of our back yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dolphin of Leith is a 1904 gaff cutter, built as a one-off on Scottish Fishing Boat lines. She&rsquo;s a mere 28ft, and we are her 5th owners. The previous owners were Iain&rsquo;s parents, who bought her in 1973 and cruised her to South Africa with Iain as a toddler and back again in 1988 with two teenage sons. So when we decided to emigrate to New Zealand after we took over the boat, there was really only one way to get her there. Sail. With our two children, Finn aged 27 months and Petra, aged 9 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So after a beautifully calm run to Weymouth, followed by a tumultuous crossing of Lyme Bay, we eventually crossed the Channel from Torquay to Trebuerden, and then slowly made our way round the North West corner of France via the Chenal du Four and the Raz du Sein to Audierne, where we waited for the weather window for Biscay. It finally came at the very end of October. It was not the easiest of crossings: the, er, &lsquo;highlight&rsquo; was bailing with a bucket out the forehatch after the forward bilge pump failed about 11pm on the first night because Vicki had helpfully left the plug out of the sink. Which won&rsquo;t happen a second time. The remainder of the crossing was a little less eventful, and we could finally enjoy some open ocean sailing in the sunshine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 4 nights at sea we arrived in Gijon feeling much buoyed up by the experience and glad that possibly one of the hardest (certainly most anticipated) legs of the journey was over. Dolphin handled the crossing beautifully, as did the children - a lot better than we did! From Gijon we coast-hopped in legs of 2-3 days around Cabo Finisterre and down the Atlantic coast of Spain and Portugal. More than once we had the pleasure of dolphins playing in Dolphin&rsquo;s bow wave, which brightens up any mood. We experienced a gale in the marina at Bayona, which sustained some damage to the topsides, but fortunately nothing so strong at sea (a mere F7 whilst bailing in Biscay!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon rounding Cabo Sao Vicente onto the Algarve at the beginning of December we experienced the joy of flat calm seas, brilliant sunshine and a broad reach. For about 2 hours. The final leg from Portimao on the Algarve to Gibraltar, where we are now, was perhaps the most eventful. It started with being becalmed in the late afternoon as we left, and just as night fell we got some wind, and at the same time saw what we assumed were 2 parachute flares off our port beam. We changed course accordingly and saw another vessel heading in a similar direction &ndash; only that vessel turned out to be the Portuguese Navy who then boarded us for an inspection. Which we passed with flying colours and were such good mates by the end of it that Iain had them sign the guest book. And we never did find out any more about the flares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast, night 2 of that passage saw us running at 4 knots under staysail only and getting seriously drenched from waves and rain whilst hand-steering&nbsp; through the Straits of Gibraltar in a system that we had not seen coming on any forecast we had looked at! Dolphin balances well on her sails&nbsp; when running or on the wind using basically a rolling hitch and a few well-placed shock cords, but when the wind is on the beam there&rsquo;s no option but to hang on to the tiller. Something we hope to rectify over the coming months. Thus it was a long night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We finally arrived in Gibraltar in time for family visits and Petra&rsquo;s first birthday, and have enjoyed Christmas and New Year celebrations here with new-found friends. All along the way we have been delighted to find that the cruising community is indeed like a village &ndash; people are so friendly and willing to help, or just have a chat over a drink. A lot like the Gaffers really.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do however now know more people in this marina than we ever did on our street in London! From here, we are Africa-bound. We have run out of spaces and hidey-holes to store any more food or juice - we probably have enough to get us all the way to NZ - the rigging has all been checked and some more adjustments made, so it&rsquo;s time to move on. We plan a couple of short stays on the African mainland before heading to the Canaries, then Cape Verdes which is our planned jump-off point for the Atlantic, most likely now in early March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, well, we&rsquo;ll just have to see where the wind is blowing. We would both like to say a huge thank-you to all the Gaffers that supported and helped us during all the planning and preparation for this trip. Without a lot of the advice, expertise, general labour, beds, dinners and babysitting not to mention spare bits of kit and useful gifts from so many of them we suspect we would be planning on racing at Yogaff again this year rather than enjoying tropical sunshine.

Having left Arnside in calm weather, &lsquo;Cock of the North&rsquo; was wrecked in a gale on her maiden voyage. She was crewed by John Jackson and his three sons and was lost when entering the Walney Channel off Piel Island with tide and wind against her. All her crew survive&nbsp;unharmed.<br />\r\n1901: Local boatmen take a collection for a replacement boat. A poem is written about the &lsquo;Cock of the North&rsquo; which is said to have been recited in the local theatre to raise money.<br />\r\n1902: John Jackson orders &lsquo;Ploughboy&rsquo; as a replacement yacht. As part of the contract Crossfields had to deliver the boat to Walney Island.<br />\r\n1907: Recorded as taking part in both Roa Island and First Barrow Yacht Club Regattas, owned by J.Jackson. In this year she won the Vickerstown and North Scale Gayner Cup, which was named after Sir George Gayner MP&nbsp;by winning it three times. (1903, 1905, 1907)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Jimmy Jackson remembered&nbsp;crewing with his father in &#39;Plougboy&#39;, along with his elder brother Harry. Jimmy&#39;s job was to shift the ballast up to the weather side when racing. When one considers that the ballast consisted of 56lb weights one can imagine that hard work was the order of the day when beating to windward. On occasions &#39;Ploughboy&#39; was skippered by a professional seaman from St Annes, and a local man by the name of Fred Woods was also known to have acted as helmsman during racing.<br />\r\n1914-5: Sold to &quot;Dutch Jack&quot; Verscholye, (the skipper of the Workington dredger), then later she was sold to Mr Ford of Haverigg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning to Barrow in the early 1920s she was purchased by Mr Thompson who modified her keel with the addition of extra weights bolted on each side.<br />\r\n1920s: Recorded as taking part in Wardleys Regatta on River Wyre near Fleetwood, owned by J.Thompson of Ramsden Dock Road, Barrow.<br />\r\n1922: Recorded as taking part in the half decked fishing boat race at Morecambe Regatta, owned T.Thompson of Morecambe, suggesting use as a fishing boat.<br />\r\n1930&nbsp;&amp; 1931: Takes part in Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by R.S.Taylor (second place, 1931).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>at some point in the 1930s &#39;Ploughboy&#39; was owned by Bill Kitchen, and international speedway and TT racer. He kept the boat at Fleetwood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1935 Takes part in Fleetwood to Isle of Man Race, owned by H.Foote. Other Crossfield yachts in the race are &lsquo;Lalla Rookh&#39; and &lsquo;Nanette&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1965: Bought by John Gill, housemaster at Rossall School, near Fleetwood. Her frames were found to be rotten. Mr Gill and his partner refastened the yacht completely and laminated 32 new oak frames and replaced several planks. A new deck was also fitted but the coach roof was left on, this being in perfect condition. (&#39;Ploughboy&#39; when built was not fitted with a cabin, so the coach&nbsp;roof would not be as old&nbsp;as the hull).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Ploughboy&rsquo; is used to teach sailing at the school.

He had her built and rigged on 1930s lines, complete with Egyptian cotton sails made by Taylors of Maldon. Gear from the period includes hemp. Her deadeyes, horse, tiller and ash blocks are from his late father&#39;s ketch &#39;Powindah&#39;, which as of 2019 was still sailing&nbsp;in British Columbian waters, based in Nanaimo. &#39;Powindah&#39; is a sister ship to &#39;Awara&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prawle&#39;s history was updated after Lance Southern, one of her original builders, kindly got in touch with us. Lance also provided some photographs of her construction. &#39;Prawle&#39; was built at the former Ferris &amp; Blank Boatyard at Old Mill Creek, Dartmouth. Ferris died in the 1940s. Blank sold the yard to the foreman, Edward Matthews, in September 1970 at a very reasonable price. Shortly before this time Ed Matthews built &#39;Prawle&#39; based on the lines of a Brittany sailing trawler after first owner, Peter Harvest, admired such a trawler in Dartmouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter&#39;s father, Colonel Harvest, ordered a motor cruiser to be built for himself at the same time. Work on &#39;Prawle&#39; started in 1965 and was completed in 1966, probably in March. Her cost was &pound;2000, including her suit of four sails which, as far as we know, are the same ones still used in 2013. There have been no significant changes since them, except (likely) a new mast at some stage which replaced the silver spruce original which had a pair of spreaders (the 2013 one has no spreaders).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only repair to her hull, apart from a couple of cracked ribs, has been an approx. 1ft section of planking let in under the port rubber around 2003 and re-caulking around the engine area, winter 2011/12. Overwinter 2013/14 we replaced&nbsp;the original engine, a Volvo MD1, with a reconditioned MD1b. Prawle had a new rudder commissioned&nbsp;in early 2017 which has now been fitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Prawle&#39; is well known in Dartmouth, especially to the local Distin family. John Distin, who still works on the Dartmouth River Taxi, was at the yard when she was built and his son Dave usually lifts her into and out of the water for us at his yard in Old Mill Creek. John also retrieved her from Brixham in 2011 after her previous engine broke down following the Heritage Regatta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unusual features and additions:<br />\r\n1) The long, deep cockpit, offering safe standing room beneath the boom, is continuous with the cabin space, apart from the non-watertight door. She is very stable with her fishing boat design and we have never been in danger of flooding, even in a heavy blow.<br />\r\n2) A later-added cabin hatch obstructed the unusual sliding cockpit cover from opening fully. I adapted this in 2012, cutting down the cover so that it once again opens fully whilst adding two separate, additional sections so that the cockpit can be fully closed if necessary eg. when left on a mooring.<br />\r\n3) In 2012 I also added cam cleats mounted on mahogany and brass assemblies which clamp-on the hatch cover rail. These do not alter the fabric of the boat, but enable the headsail sheets to be controlled from the cockpit. The mainsheet cleats were also moved into the cabin, a small material change.<br />\r\n4) Prawle had a new switch panel added in 2011, mounted on mahogany, and a depth-sounder fitted for the first time. She has no other electronic instruments.<br />\r\n5) 2013 lazy jacks were added, another non-original feature.<br />\r\n6) New Mahogany gallows installed 2015<br />\r\n7)&nbsp;New rudder 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image_key":"4vLsBG","uk_part1":"308290","spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel Mahogony on canadian rock elm oak deadwoods, elm keel, iroko transom, Columbian pine deck and cabin beams, ply decks.","draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":12.75,"head":8.25,"luff":12.5},"topsail":{"luff":10.75,"perpendicular":6},"length_overall":5.8674,"calculated_thcf":0.848,"fore_triangle_base":3.3528,"length_on_waterline":5.1298,"fore_triangle_height":5.7912},"hull_form":"long keel sloping forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":5.8674,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>&#39;Prawle&#39; was built as a yacht in 1965 on Breton fishing boat lines.</p>","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":2.0056,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"846a15b6-0225-4ba3-ba72-969fe4c531cd","designer":"638a14e8-1db1-459b-8a6d-3cd927221589","design_class":null,"constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"wood"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":null,"designerByDesigner":{"name":"R.

In 2018 she was bought by Arnside Sailing Club with the help of a Heritage Lottery grant to have an example of a Crossfield&rsquo;s boat in the village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crossfields were the leading builders of Morecambe Bay Prawners. They also built yachts, rowing boats and dinghies, including Arthur Ransome&rsquo;s &#39;Swallow&#39; and &#39;Coch-y-bonddhu&#39;. There were two boatyards operated by Crossfields in Arnside. Beach Walk on the shore ran by William where &#39;Severn&#39; was built and Top Shop on Church Hill which was run by his younger brothers and then his nephews as Crossfield Brothers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;Severn&#39; is one of ten Rivers Class Yachts built by William Crossfield and Sons for the River Mersey Yacht Club. Six were built in 1912 with a further Four in 1914. If it was not for the First World War it is probable that more would have been built. Four other Rivers Class yachts are thought to be still in existence: &#39;<a href=\"http://www.oga.org.uk/boat/deva\">Deva</a>&#39;, &#39;<a href=\"http://www.oga.org.uk/boat/dart\">Dart</a>&#39;, &#39;<a href=\"http://www.oga.org.uk/boat/styx\">Styx</a>&#39; (all on the OGA Register) and &#39;Esk&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The River Class were used largely for evening racing with a season running from May to July, with regatta race in July. The boats were also raced in August at the Straits Regatta on Anglesey. They were raced for prize money. In 1914 prize money was &pound;44 when the average wage was &pound;67. The Royal Mersey Yacht Club was based in Rock Ferry, a then prosperous area of Birkenhead with large houses overlooking the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design was based upon the Blackpool and Fleetwood Jewel Class. The boats were originally opened decked. They had a crew of three. The boats cost &pound;50 each delivered afloat with a further &pound;14.18s for the sails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original owners of Rivers Class boats included members of the Liverpool merchant elite, three silver medallists in the 1908 Olympics, one of whom was also a Rugby Union International and a British Lions manager. In 1925 the 17th Earl of Derby, who was Commodore of the Royal Mersey Yacht Club and Secretary of State for War 1916-18 and a leading racehorse breeder brought Ogwen, followed by &#39;Deva&#39; in 1926. The Derby in the title refers to the West Derby area of Lancashire, which includes Liverpool &nbsp;rather than the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Severn was originally called &quot;Elwy&quot; after a river in North Wales. Her first owner was L.S.Stott. Elwy was the joint winner of the 1913 Rivers Class series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1914 she was sold to Commander Harvey Broadbent of HMS Conway, a merchant navy training ship anchored off Rock Ferry and a stern disciplinarian. She was&nbsp;named Ribble, after the river that flows through Preston. Ribble capsized iand sunk in a Royal Mersey Race on 23 July&nbsp;1914 just 11 days before the outbreak of World War One in very windy conditions when rounding a buoy. Her crew made up of Commander Broadbent and two cadets were rescued..&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1927 she was discovered on the bed of the River Mersey and raised to the surface by the Mersey Docks Board salvage boat &ldquo;Salvor&rdquo;. She was found to be in good condition and sold by the Receiver of Wrecks to Joe Wallace, aged 25 of New Brighton, a member of the West Cheshire Yacht Club for &pound;25. Joe Wallace named the boat &#39;Severn&#39;. &nbsp;It is thought that Joe Wallace did not keep her for very long, moving on to bigger yachts. &#39;Severn&#39; is next recorded in 1939 winning a race at the West Cheshire Regatta at New Brighton and coming second in a race at Blundellsands near Formby north of Liverpool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the early 1970s Severn was in North Wales. In 1972 Severn was advertised for sale by A.G.Taylor of Plas Mor, Borth y Gest, a village on a sheltered bay south of Portmadog in Wales overlooked by the hills of Snowdonia for &pound;650. Severn was brought by Mr Gaynor of Leigh on Sea near Southend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Gaynor did not keep Severn for all that long, advertising her for sale&nbsp;for &pound;1100 in 1976, Boat details include a cooker and tiolet. She was brought by Ken Tomlinson of Hockley, north of Southend.&nbsp;Around 1980 Severn featured in an article in the&nbsp;Longshoreman Magazine. Severn was kept at Paglesham on the Roach Estuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1984.Ken Tomlinson advertised her for sale for &pound;2000. She was brought by a&nbsp;young Americain lady with two&nbsp;children for &pound;750 at Heybridge Basin who used her as a family boat and for racing enjoying many splendid adventures. Eventually she sold Severn on to a senoir Fire Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jon Wainwright, owner of &#39;Deva&#39;, another Rivers Class yacht, mentions competing against &#39;Severn&#39; in a race in 1986 on the River Blackwater in his book &ldquo;Only so Many Tides&rdquo;. &#39;Deva&#39; beat &#39;Severn&#39;. In 1987 Severn was recorded as been kept at Heybridge on the Blackwater Estuary near Maldon in an article about Styx another Rivers Class yacht.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1999 &#39;Severn&#39; was moved to the River Medway in Kent. In 2013 after several years of neglect, she was taken back to Essex to the Roach Estuary north of Southend where she was restored over a two year period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018 she was bought by Arnside Sailing Club for &pound;5500 funded by a Heritage Lottery grant and returned to the village where she was built. Moored in the Kent Estuary at Arnside, she lies at the top of Morecambe Bay in summer just 300 yards away from where she was built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partly as a result of buying Severn, Arnside Sailing Club were selected as RYA North West Sailing Club of the Year&nbsp; 2019 and shortlisted for the national award .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A video was made of her return to Arnside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzdyE9fs7ps\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzdyE9fs7ps</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Friends Group has been set up to maintain, fund and sail her.<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:crossfieldyachtsevern@gmail.com?subject=Yacht%20Severn%20listed%20on%20the%20OGA%20website\">Contact&nbsp;the Friends by email</a>&nbsp;if you wish to join or support the group.</p>","image_key":"57NNsz","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel built with counter stern.

She was originally fitted with a single cylinder Dan paraffin engine developing 28hp and attained 6 knots on trials, sufficient for her intended work over the oyster layings in the Rivers Crouch and Roach, which are sheltered waters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dan engines were in 1908 a well-known make for marine work and the first was installed in 1895. These operated on paraffin and by 1907 about 1500 had been installed in fishing and commercial craft. The company located at Ipswich and also offered to build craft for clients. They were producing a diesel engine by 1912. It is possible that Speedwell was designed by Linton Hope and Co. naval architects of London as they were in 1908 suppliers of Dan engines and designed numbers of motor and auxiliary fishing vessels as well as yachts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1908 Burnham on Crouch and most other coastal communities in Britain and elsewhere were familiar with auxiliary and full power motor driven craft, yachts and commercial vessels and had great interest in their efficiency, costs and development. The introduction of the reliable paraffin, petrol, petrol/paraffin, diesel and semi-diesel marine engine was the greatest advance ever offered to those earning their living afloat in sailing fishing and coasting vessels, whatever romantics may think. It offered them independence from calms and to some extent from contrary tides and introduced the possibility of some regularity of landings or delivery of cargoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burnham men were as well acquainted with this as any for the British Motor Boat Club held their annual racing meet there after the first in 1904, where some advanced boats competed and auxiliary and full power motor yachts were regularly using the anchorage from that time in increasing numbers and no doubt attracted keen interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There had previously been and contemporarily were several steam oyster dredgers working from Burnham, besides a number of sailing smacks from there and Paglesham. The decision to build a motor dredger was logical in the climate of that time when the marine internal combustion engine was advancing rapidly and was already well accepted in working small craft and yachts because of its economy and convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speedwell&#39;s first cost was just over half that of a comparable steam dredger and the manning expenses were less. Her crew was three men, of whom one was engineer. As far as can be discovered, and photographs confirm, Speedwell was built without a rig. She had a clipper bow and a very short and light bowsprit for appearance and to balance her counter stern in profile. She was steered with a tiller, had a prominent coachroof over the engine room and a large cowl ventilator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her principal dimensions were 50ft x 12ft 9ins moulded breadth x 5ft 9ins depth moulded. She carried 12 tons of ballast to achieve an acceptable draught for dredging purposes. It seems unlikely she was ever subsequently rigged as a cutter and her full form had almost no resemblance to that of the typical Essex smack. It&#39;s unknown when she was rigged, but it was probably when she was sold to owners in Kent, where her low power engine would have made her impracticable as a purely motor craft for work in the most exposed coastal waters. This no doubt led to her being re-engined with a 25-30hp 2 cylinder Kelvin engine which gave 7 knots in smooth water, when owned by the Seesalter and Ham Oyster Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was later rigged as a ketch, without a topmast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owner Simon Knight moved to New Zealand, leaving the boat in Shoreham, when she was bought by Suzi Walker in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simon Knight, Speedwell&#39;s previous owner, made contact in Dec 2017 having seen Speedwell on the website. he writes: <em>I have been on the OGA web site and saw her entry in the boat registry and felt that I must contact you as there is&nbsp; an entry by Keith Allso which is not altogether correct. He as many others has got her date of build wrong, should be 1901. She was not built for the Smith Bros but probably built for an American. He also got her dimensions wrong, she is 52ft long and 14ft 6in beam. On the engine details again he is wrong, the replacement Kelvin engine was Petrol/Diesel 44HP giving upto 8knots. I cruised at 7Knots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe has actually got the wrong Speedwell, there were two in Whitstable and nearly every writer has got them mixed. I found her true history when I took Speedwell to Whitstable and the East coast where I met the Skipper and crew who worked her out of Whitstable. I also met David Patients who has the designers half model where it clearly states her name,&nbsp; designers name, William King of Burnham on Crouch dated 1901 and other details.

After the first World War she was sold again, had her first engine installed in 1920, and relocated to Burnham, and later West Mersea where she was found and bought by Maurice Griffiths, who re-named her Storm.&nbsp; She was owned twice by Maurice Griffiths, past editor of Yachting Monthly, and he describes her in his books, in particular &#39;Magic of the Swatchways&#39;. In &#39;Dream Boats&#39; he describes her as &#39;My little 7 tonner Storm was built as a miniature bawley yacht, but with somewhat finer lines, and I always regarded her as one of the most endearing little craft I have ever owned.&#39; He had to sell her and vowed he&#39;d buy her back which he did six years later.&nbsp; The owner between 1924 and 1930 when MG bought her back, was a Mr Eustace Mason, who founded the Claygate Cement works.&nbsp; MG sold her again in 1931, and she was re-located to Poole, to take part in races organised by the Parkstone Sailing Club.&nbsp; The owner then was a Col J M Hulton, a veteran of the Boer Wars, the First World War, and the Irish troubles in the 1920&#39;s.&nbsp; There are records of her not doing too well in the 1935&nbsp;round the island (IOW) race.&nbsp; Storm drops out of the Lloyds Registers in 1937, and the next record I have found was the hand written receipt included in her paperwork, when the then owner John Derrick of Fareham sold her to David Cade in 1962.&nbsp; John Derrick appears to have been an actor in the Portsmouth area, but the record is cold between 1937 and 1962 - I would love to find out where she was in those years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David J Cade passed away on 17 July 2002, when serving as OGA President having owned Storm from 1962.

In the period to the late 1970s early 1980s, she was used for pleasure and as a work-horse, positioning mooring buoys in support of his role as Bosun of Marchwood Sailing Club before the latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s saw a turndown in fortunes leaving &lsquo;Reprieve&rsquo; permanently laid up at Quayside Marina in Southampton.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Looking for a retirement project in 1994, I heard that Cyril was perhaps looking to sell /Reprieve/, which required fairly extensive renovation. Being an innocent in the shipwrights world, but wise enough to be sure that the hull was in good shape, an agreement was finally struck with a still somewhat reluctant Cyril on a very wet November day in 1994, with rain pouring in through the skylights and us standing up to our ankles in water in the main cabin. Put simply, I acquired the ownership/stewardship of &lsquo;Reprieve&rsquo;, together with Cyril&rsquo;s skills which would be so essential to the success of the renovation project. I then left for a six month break in New Zealand, naively convinced that sailing would be on the cards before the end of 1995. Well we all have our dreams.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>26 May 1995 saw the start of the project, with &lsquo;Reprieve&rsquo; moved to, and lifted out at Kemps Quay. Once ashore she was found to have surprisingly little marine growth on her bottom considering it was the first lift out for 17 years, perhaps in part due to one of the many of Cyril&rsquo;s &lsquo;concoctions&rsquo; with which it became progressively evident had so well preserved her.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Only one small patch of fresh water rot being found in the hull side planking, and this caused by a rain water run off from the covering board. The external planking would need re- caulking; the decks would require replacement as would the mast, spars and rigging. Internally she would require to be &ldquo;gutted&rdquo; with a replacement required for the old Kelvin Petrol Paraffin &ldquo;Puffer&rdquo; Engine installed by Cyril many years earlier. The six month renovation was starting to look a little ambitious!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The very hot dry summer of 1995 necessitated a minimum period ashore and saw rapid progress in the completion of the below waterline repairs including replacement of the rudder fittings, caulking and bitumen coating of the bottom. As a cost saving, antifouling and the fitting of anodes were omitted on the recommendations of the manufacturers, due to location on a mud berth and the lack of onboard electrics. The end of July saw her back at her mooring in Quayside Marina with a clear delineation of work pattern emerging, Cyril handling technical repairs and deck replacement, with his inexperienced assistant or &ldquo;boy&rdquo; as he usually called me, carrying out the internal rebuilding, the &ldquo;fripperies&rdquo; which really didn&rsquo;t interest him greatly. As those who know and sailed with him will recall, for Cyril the sailing was what counted and he would sail her hard, often with a petrol driven pump stemming the water inflow through un-caulked planking which his 24/7 working life often did not allow the time to address.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The period through to the end of March 1996 saw a total clearout on deck and of the interior, commencement of burning off of the old interior hull paint, a start to re-planking the foredeck, dropping the mast, which after removal of all rigging formed a ridge pole for the &ldquo;over cover&rdquo; creating what was somewhat unkindly referred to as &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo;, and other comments such as, &ldquo;where are the widow boxes&rdquo; . On the upside, it created a great spacious warm and dry full height work area in the cockpit, which served us well over the next nine years.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>April 1996 through March 1997 saw little input from me due to an unexpected consultancy assignment in the USA. Notwithstanding, Cyril made considerable progress, completing the burn-off and repainting of the internal hull planking, overhauling a replacement engine, installing a new driveline of his own design incorporating the old Kelvin couplings and a Range Rover drive shaft leading up to successful engine trials in June 1997.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>By now it had become evident the huge footage and cost of timber required for decking and fitting out the interior. With new timber other than for special trim being out of the question, we directed our attention to the local demolition companies. We were lucky as C J Rogers had recently removed a wooden factory floor, which in quality, quantity and price met &ldquo;Reprieve&rsquo;s&rdquo; total needs.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>With timber supplies resolved, progress continued apace in the period April 1997 through September 1999. Forward and Main Cabin floors were laid, bulkheads, cupboards and furniture assembled and fitted, bunks made for forward and main cabins, new companionway built and fitted, galley and chartroom constructed and deck heads and side trims fitted throughout.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Sadly, on 9 September 1999, whilst being moved to another berth within the marina, and misjudging both the rate of the falling water level and the position of the bank on the approach to the new berth she ran aground. Once grounded, re-floating was not a consideration until the next tide. Unfortunately, only being caulked to 6&rdquo; above the waterline she did not re-float despite the magnificent efforts of the Fire Brigade who turned out 3 engines and many portable pumps, Mr Diesel who brought pumps and many others. It was two days before she could be righted and re-floated. After the initial shock, where Cyril and I saw five years work covered in silt, necessitating major cleaning and stripping of much of our new internal structure, also the badly damaged reconditioned engine, we could well have thrown in the towel.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The New Millennium saw the &ldquo;Phoenix raised from the ashes&rdquo;, with work recommencing in May 2000 following a winter of cleaning and drying out. Some twelve months was taken up in recovering the position pre the sinking with 2002 seeing significant progress once again, with completion of the internal woodwork, painting and varnishing and fittings in the Heads, Galley, Chartroom and Forward and Main Cabins. On deck, Cyril was progressing with laying his decks and I made a start on the topsides by building the new Forward Hatch, overhauling the Main Skylights and fitting New Galley Skylight and a new Companionway Hatch, also starting the reconstruction of the cockpit, lockers and hatches, after initially raising the floor by 6 inches.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Cyril&rsquo;s health sadly did not enable him to contribute as in the past, his interest remained high and he continued workshop based support. Contractor technical support now became a factor and cost within the project through to completion. Significant progress was achieved in 2003, including the installation of the pressurised hot and cold water system, new Yanmar 3GM30F engine and the associated electrics, drive shaft, exhaust system and fuel tank, cockpit drains, also the starboard side deck was laid and the steering gear (an old truck steering shaft and box designed and fitted by Cyril many years earlier) overhauled and refitted. Upholstery was fitted throughout and living aboard at last became possible with goodbye finally being said to &ldquo;Mischief&rdquo; my &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; boat owned from new in 1979 and latterly used as my summer caravan.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>June 2004 saw further upheaval following the need by the marina to remove the section of pontoons which had been Reprieve&rsquo;s berth since the sinking. Kemps Marina stepped into the breach allocating Reprieve the only berth that had been dredged to accept a deep keel at low water. Complaints followed from a number of berth holders unhappy to associate their &ldquo;pride and joy plastic boats&rdquo; with &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark, forgetting of course the story of the Ugly Duckling. Despite the disruption, work proceeded apace, the one rotten hull plank replaced, the cockpit completed with engine controls, instrumentation and floor decked out and construction of the bulwarks commenced. Canvas skylight, cockpit and hatch covers were made up ready for the day when after ten years the &ldquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark&rdquo; top would be removed in the spring of 2005.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The tenth anniversary of the commencement of the &ldquo;six month project&rdquo; was the start of a momentous year. Initially, with the &ldquo;ugly duckling&rdquo; transformed into the &ldquo;swan&rdquo;, with the removal of the covers, followed by not only on-going interest from those who had complained but even apologies were offered for previous attitudes.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>With the removal of the covers work progressed with fitting the bulwarks until the exciting day of 8th August 2005, when &ldquo;Reprieve&rdquo; made her way down the River Itchen under her own power to American Wharf for lift out and below the water line clean and any necessary repairs, also complete burn off, caulking and painting of waterline to deck prior to the Over- side Survey&rdquo;. In parallel the port side deck laid by Cyril was to be replaced to bring it to the same standard as that professionally laid on the starboard side. Eight exhausting weeks later with all targets met thanks to the many helpers, she was back at her berth looking a picture and justifying the cracking of a bottle of Bubbly.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Topsides was the centre of activity for 2006, starting with repairs to and re-covering the coach roof, the fitting of the capping rail to the bulwarks and repainting all topsides woodwork. Doesn&rsquo;t sound much, but it filled all the available working time that summer. With the exterior now complete the time had at last come to consider the new mast, spars and rigging. A meeting was held on the 3rd November 2006 in the car park of Kemps Marina with Peter Martin of Martins Rigging Ltd and Matt Sutherland of Sutherlands Traditional Shipwrights who was to build the mast and spars, where all &ldquo;Reprieve&rsquo;s&rdquo; sails new and old were laid out. The old flax sails were sadly beyond repair, but incredibly there was also a complete set of new sails, which had never even been out of the sail bags since they were made around 1978. A rig design was finalised, the shock of the cost absorbed and a deal struck, with a completion target of spring 2007.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The target was not achieved and it was not until the 11th September 2007, on a glorious sunny day that the mast was finally stepped in its tabernacle aboard &ldquo;Reprieve&rdquo; atop a new 2007 penny. The delay in the mast and spars build was worth it, having provided the opportunity to be involved at all stages from timber selection through to the application of the 22nd and final coat of varnish. Completion of the rig, minor adjustments, final survey and getting a weather window to test sails etc., delayed the &ldquo;big day&rdquo;, the Sea Trials until the 24th October 2007. However, on the day she performed perfectly, despite rather than because of the too many Cooks, sorry Captains. The only cook on board being my other half Lilian, who kept all well supplied with bacon and sausage rolls and coffee Photo 28). &ldquo;Reprieve&rdquo; sailed beautifully without a single leak found.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The weather and other commitments scuppered further sailing; however, I am hopeful that 2008 will offer both the weather and the opportunity to participate with other members at functions of the Old Gaffers Association, so that the fruits of this &ldquo;six month&rdquo; retirement project can be enjoyed to the full.</blockquote>","image_key":"P2LKQM","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"Carvel pitch pine on oak","draft":1.6764,"generic_type":"unknown","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":23,"head":16.5,"luff":20},"topsail":{"luff":21,"perpendicular":13.5},"length_overall":10.668,"calculated_thcf":1.039,"fore_triangle_base":5.4864,"length_on_waterline":9.144,"fore_triangle_height":12.192},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":10.668,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"<p>Built around the turn of the century at Newman&rsquo;s Boatyard, &lsquo;Reprieve&rsquo; was one of only two pilot cutters recorded as constructed in Poole, Dorset.

She replaced the anchor chain with multiplait and reorganised the main sheet arrangement, reefing and running backstays. She attended to all the rigging requirements of the 2012 insurance survey. Marion sailed East Breeze to the Beaulieu River, Marchwood Yacht Club, Newtown Creek, Island Harbour, Wootton Creek, Lymington, and Yarmouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 Ian Macgillivray, professional boat builder of Bluff&rsquo;s Quay, Southampton advised and assisted in stripping and sheathing&nbsp; the foredeck. This was then painted with two part polyurethane primer and International Toplac. He also replaced the starboard side of the forecabin by means of a scarphe joint. The foredeck cleats were replaced and fitted with cushions below decks and some fittings regalvanised. The bobstay fittings were bolted rather than screwed to the boat. Ian also built the housing allowing the bowsprit to be run in to the boat. Marion sailed East Breeze to Yarmouth, Portsmouth and Bembridge. East Breeze was present at Cowes for the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Old Gaffers Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spring 2014, Marion removed the quarter round beading from cockpit and side decks and Ian continued the programme of rebuild and improvement by removing the cabin sides from East Breeze and peeling away all the sheathing from side decks and cockpit. Considerable water ingress and rot was discovered. The port side deck was totally replaced as were the cockpit and cabin sides, all the cockpit flat areas, the stern deck, the bridge deck, starboard and stern inwhales and internal sternpost. Teak corner posts were added in the cock pit and forward and aft in the cabin. The cabin roof, side decks, stern deck and cockpit flats were sheathed and repainted with two part epoxy primer and two part top coat. A new locker was constructed and tiling added to allow the installation of a Taylor&rsquo;s diesel heater, the water supply relocated to below the chart table and the boat completely rewired with new batteries, cabin lights, log and echo sounder, an additional mini-contest compass and 12v sockets. Tufnell winches were installed and all works required and recommended by the 2012 insurance survey were completed. Spinlock jammers were installed to aid luff tension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marion sailed East Breeze to the Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival then to the OGA Bembridge Rally and onwards, single handed, to the Dutch Old Gaffers Cross Country Tour, crossing the Channel from Dover to Dunkerque. She sailed 809 nautical miles in total and was away just under two months, crossing back from Dunkerque to Dover and on to Brighton and East Cowes in an engine assisted passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original engine, a Yanmar SE8 gave trouble on this voyage by not starting when warm and was found to have a cracked cylinder head, probably due to intake of particles which impeded water supply for cooling. A replacement head was sourced and fitted for the 2015 season. In this season, Marion sailed East Breeze to the Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival, the Gaffers&#39; Poole Rally and the Annual Rally at Cowes and Haslar. Also to Ryde and on a week&#39;s tour of creeks and rivers of The Solent taking in the Beaulieu River, Newtown, Newport, Wootton and Haslar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2016, East Breeze was once again at Bluff&#39;s Quay. Ian removed&nbsp;the starboard side cockpit upright and floor, and the YSE8 engine. Marion cleaned and painted the bilges prior to the installation of a Beta 14 engine and replacement of the wooen parts including a cockpit floor and hatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marion sailed East Breeze to the Medina River and then in stormy conditions under three reefs to the Yarmouth Gaffers regatta. About two weeks later, Marion and East Breeze left the Solent via Yarmouth, sailed to Alderney, on to Guernsey and thence to Treguier. They continued by way of Perros Guirec, Roscoff, L&#39;Aberwrach and Isle Molene to Camaret where crew Mary Gibbs joined the ship. They continued to the Brest Festival and onwards to the Douarnenez festival, suffering a collapse of the backstays and gaff halyard. This was replaced at Douarnenez with help from Janet and Mike Gurney in Passager. Marion, Mary and East Breeze returned via Camaret to L&#39;Aberwrach, Roscoff and Morlaix where Mary left by train to rejoin her own ship. Marion continued to Trebeurden, the Treguier River, Pontrieux and Lezardrieux before crossing the channel to Guernsey, Alderney and Yarmouth prior to joining a the Solent Gaffers in the Beaulieu River at Ginns Farm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017 following routine maintenance, and the customary early season Solent Gaffers events, Marion sailed East Breeze to The Folly and on to Weymouth. She crossed Lyme Bay to the River Exe, spent a night on a buoy and then visited Topsham. She sailed by way of Brixham to Dartmouth, anchoring in the river and leaving East Breeze in Dartmouth whilst joining the Classic Channel Regatta. She rejoined East Breeze and sailed her to Salcombe and then to Fowey, returning to Plymouth to explore the harbour and Tamar River before joining the Gaffers Sou b&#39; Sou&#39; West Rally at Plymouth. She sailed in company to Salcombe and back to Dartmouth, visiting Totnes in rain and cold before joining the South West Gaffers Dittisham Rally. She then returned in company to Weymouth and to Yarmouth. The passage to Yarmouth was windier than forecast and East Breeze&#39;s mainsail disintegrated en route. Marion met former owners, the Barrs, in Yarmouth and enjoyed discussing the history of repairs and improvements to East Breeze. In late September, Marion sailed East Breeze to Lymington where she was measured for a new main by Pete Sanders who confirmed that the damaged sail was the original at 40+ years old. Marion made a new winter cover for East Breeze in late 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","image_key":"WP6FjB","uk_part1":null,"spar_material":null,"construction_details":"GRP hull, ply deck & cabin","draft":0.9144,"generic_type":"Yacht","handicap_data":{"main":{"foot":13,"head":11.83,"luff":13},"length_overall":6.7056,"calculated_thcf":0.865,"fore_triangle_base":3.6576,"length_on_waterline":6.4008,"fore_triangle_height":6.5532},"hull_form":"long keel deep forefoot","keel_laid":null,"launched":null,"length_on_deck":6.7056,"mainsail_type":"gaff","sail_type":{"name":"gaff"},"short_description":"","updated_at":"2021-01-09T14:51:37.327394+00:00","website":"","beam":2.4384,"air_draft":null,"reference":null,"builder":"a6482c01-706a-469d-93db-2ccab9020581","designer":"248b3a1a-e45d-4490-8de7-aaa23ab100b9","design_class":"ffd82ea5-0656-4af6-b5b7-55bfb57c26dc","constructionMaterialByConstructionMaterial":{"name":"grp"},"constructionMethodByConstructionMethod":{"name":"unknown"},"designClassByDesignClass":{"name":"Tamarisk 22"},"designerByDesigner":{"name":"David M.

Her dimensions would have allowed her to have raced in the 25ft waterline class popular in the 1880s or perhaps in the 2.5 rating class popular in the 1890&#39;s. Her Lloyds registration certificate dates back to 1917 and Lloyds registers of Yachts include a Kestrel of very similar dimensions back to 1904, always being based on the East Coast. Any earlier history is unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Past owners include the nautical authors George Arnott, Harvey Benham and Richard Woodman. Kestrel reached her 100th year in a rather sorry state of repair. By the 1960s she was leaking badly and in an effort to preserve her she was sheathed in glass fibre. This enabled her to continue sailing until 1991 when she was deemed too&nbsp;unsound to continue afloat. Her engine was Coventry Victor, Petrol, 3.5 of 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchased by James Palmer for &pound;1 in 1997 she was largely rebuilt over the next four years. Kestrel is constructed of teak planking on oak timbers. Originally built without a ballast keel, a ton of lead was bolted to the original elm keel prior to 1930 along with various lead infills presumably to improve her stability</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She now has an opepe keel supporting the same lead ballast. The deck was replaced and constructed of Russian deal on plywood, the lay of the deck being similar to that removed and typical of the period. Of the original boat only two thirds of the planking, tiller, mast and boom remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kestrel&#39;s current rig (2013) is around 620 square ft. Enlarged slightly from the 1991 rig it is still somewhat smaller than the 800 square ft listed in 1904.

The inspiration behind the design dates back from way before with the fibreglass hull mould being taken from a 1922 Brightlingsea fishing smack called ‘Brownie’. The heavy fibreglass mould retains the marks of the planking from the original boat so that only on close examination it becomes apparent she is not an original wooden craft. The seats, cockpit floor, cabin doors, tiller,  rubbing strake and trim are mahogany.  The practicality of the open layout together with the shoal draft and centreplate makes Little Millie equally at home taking the ground at low tide or slipped onto a trailer. Over 150 Memories have been built and are now a well proven classic in their own right; safe, easily handled yet fast boats with numerous wins to their credit in Old Gaffers Association events. Little Millie is registered with the OGA (No 934) and has competed in the Falmouth Classics in recent years.  Designed originally as an ‘open’ boat the accommodation is modest but practical, with two full sized berths (new cushions in 2018) and some storage in a vee formation in the snug little cabin under the foredeck accessed by twin cabin doors and lifting hatch. The large cockpit has room to comfortably sail with up to 6 adults. A boat tent (new 2018) extends the accommodation allowing fun family camping adventures aboard.  The impressive gaff rig is very practical and easy to use, the large sail area can be simply set, controlled and reefed from the large cockpit. Little Millie can be rigged as a gaff sloop or cutter with two headsails from her bowsprit. The wardrobe of tan sails include gaff mainsail with two slab reefing options, 2 x Genoa’s with bronze Wykeham Martin furling system, inner jib and storm jib  The Memory has internal ballast, as did her wooden ancestors. This is lead ingots contained within compartments on either side of the centreplate case, making the Memory about one ton fully ballasted meaning she can easily be towed behind a moderate car or 4X4. Little Millie has a Mersey galvanised Road trailer (bought 2017 cost £2,640) with less than 500 miles since new. The trailer has never been submerged as under my ownership the boat was always lifted into water.  The 50Kg galvanised centreplate pivots under the cockpit sole, and is easily raised on it's own block and tackle - a new lifting cable was fitted in 2019. Little Millie draws only 18 inches with the plate lifted and 39 inches with it down.  The 20 foot solid pine mast is easily stepped in a steel deck mounted tabernacle with stainless steel standing rigging to bronze chain plates. The main sheet runs on a traditional traveller through a modern block with cam. Vintage Tufnol winches are fitted port and starboard for Genoa sheets.   Yamaha 4hp two stroke long shaft outboard mounted on lifting engine bracket (serviced 2020). Fuel tank with hose and squeeze pump.   Other equipment includes flush deck compass, 15kg CQR anchor with 5m galvanised chain and 20m warp. Cockpit mooring cover and mast scissor support. Whale Gusher bilge pump. Safety rescue throwing line, and emergency boarding ladder.   Little Millie has been sailed enthusiastically and comes with the knocks and scrapes that you expect from a 40 year old boat. She is not concours, but is in good condition overall, with lots of character and ready to sail.  Little Millie is currently on a mooring on the Helford River which may be transferable to the new owner.","sold":"2020-10-21","summary":"","updated_at":"2020-08-17T19:33:06.667741+00:00"}],"engine_installations":[]}}}}
