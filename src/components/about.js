        <Typography>In the early 1970s John Scarlett, the first OGA Secretary, started collecting data on members' boats. The records have grown to include nearly 3,500 craft, forming a unique record. Mainly gaff rigged, old and new, workboats and yachts, the Register also contains classic bermudan yachts and motorboats. Data have been stored electronically since the 1980s and in 2016 the OGA launched the register online. Whilst primarily a record of members boats the register has become an important historical record of working and leisure craft and are happy to receive details about interesting boats regardless of their association with the OGA. OGA Members can list boats 'For Sale' at no additional charge.


You are browsing the latest new version of the online register. The new register will feature separate online forms for adding a new boat, updating an existing entry and putting a boat up for sale. If you prefer you can still download a form to print, fill in by hand and post to us.


An important feature of a boat's entry are photographs. The online forms allow you to upload digital photographs but if you only have prints, slides or negatives please contact the boat register editors.


If you have bought or sold a boat let us know so we can update the ownership details

Boat register form
If your boat is not in the register, we would love to include it. Contact the Boat Register Editor with a few details.

We have a new online form and we would love you to try it out. If you prefer to fill in a paper form, you can download one and post it to us with pictures and we will add it to the database.

If you find either of the forms confusing get in touch and we will help you.

Once we've confirmed your boat isn't already on the register we will create an entry. If you are an OGA member you will be able to fill in the details and add photographs online.

If you have bought or sold a boat let us know so we can update the ownership details.
